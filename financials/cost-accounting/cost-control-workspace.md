# Cost control overview 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **Cost control** workspace is introduced as a central point where managers who are responsible for controlling a cost object or a set of cost objects within a dimension or across dimensions, for example, cost centers and product groups can access reports. The reports in the workspace are fully managed by cost accountants. This ensures consistency in layout and data used for reporting across the entire organization.

## Cost control workspace configuration

Cost accountants can define as many report configurations as desired to fit into the desired data composition or layout. A report configuration consists of 6 sections, which all contribute to either selecting the targeted data composition or the layout.

To configure a cost control workspace, click **Cost accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Cost control workspace configuration**.

### General

In this section, you can create a new unique report layout. The name of the report will be the unique identifier for end users to recognize in the **Cost control** workspace. You can also decide whether the report should be shared or kept internal for cost accountants.

### Data filtering

In this section, data foundation of the report is defined. The end users of this report will see values in the report after source data has been processed.

| Field                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cost accounting ledger                                           | Displays the **Cost accounting ledger** on which the report is based. The value is derived from the field **Cost control unit**.              |
| Cost control unit                                                | Selecting a **Cost control unit** determines from which **Cost accounting ledger** and which **Cost objects** this report will be based upon. |
| Statistical dimension hierarchy Cost element dimension hierarchy | A **Cost control workspace** configuration record can report either non-monetary or monetary values, but not in the same layout. Select a <ul><li>**Cost element dimension hierarchy** for reporting monetary values.</li><li>**Statistical dimension hierarchy** for reporting non-monetary values.</li></ul><br>The dimension hierarchy record selected determines the structure of the reporting and aggregation levels. <br> Note: If non-monetary or monetary values are required side by side, you can export data to Excel for the Power BI content pack.   |
| Cost object dimension hierarchy                                  | Select the dimension hierarchy of the cost object dimension that suits the purpose of the reporting being defined.                            |
| Budget original version                                          | Select the budget version ID which in the context of this report acts as the original budget.                                                 |
| Budget revised version                                           | Select the budget version ID which in the context of this report acts as the revised budget.                                                  |

### Assign calculation records

The overhead calculation performs several calculation steps on the source data, for example, cost behavior classification, cost distribution and cost allocation. The system allows performing multiple overhead calculations for the same fiscal period in case missing source data is discovered or certain rules need to be updated. Each overhead calculation is saved with a unique ID. The cost accountant can select the specific overhead calculation ID. The end users, for example, managers, of the report will see the results of the overhead calculation in the **Cost control** workspace.

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The selected value will now represent the current period and **Year to date** and **Year to date average** will be updated accordingly. |

### Columns to display for costs

In this section, the cost accountant decides which columns the report layout should contain. There are three categorizations: Fixed cost, Variable cost and Unclassified cost.

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed cost            | This column type displays the fixed cost based on the selected **Overhead calculation ID.** <br>Note: This column type will only show a balance when an **Overhead calculation ID** is selected for the fiscal period.                   |
| Variable cost         | This column type displays the variable cost based on the selected **Overhead calculation ID**. <br>Note: This column type will only show a balance when an **Overhead calculation ID** is selected for the fiscal period.                |
| Fixed + variable cost | This column type displays the **Fixed cost and Variable cost** based on the selected **Overhead calculation ID**. <br>Note: This column type will only show a balance when an overhead calculation ID is selected for the fiscal period. |
| Total cost            | This column type displays the **Total cost** (**Unclassified, Fixed cost and Variable cost**). <br>Note: The column type will show the balance at all time.                                                                              |
| Unclassified cost     | This column type displays the unclassified cost. <br>Note: This can be used to validate if all costs have been correctly classified by the overhead calculation or if the cost behavior rules need to be adjusted.                       |

### Columns to display for budgeted costs

In this section, the cost accountant decides which columns should be displayed for the selected budget versions. Individual selections can be done for original and revised budget.

Note: As the fields listed below behave the same way for original and revised budget, they will only be explained once.

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Variance period threshold | Allow setting a threshold for the variance in monetary amount for the current period. If the threshold is exceeded, the line will be highlighted with a red color in the **Cost control** workspace. <br>Note: This only applies to the cost elements that represent expenditures. |
| Variance year threshold   | Allow setting a threshold for the variance in monetary amount for the year. If the threshold is exceeded, the line will be highlighted with a red color in the **Cost control** workspace.                                                                                     |
| Variance threshold %      | Allow setting a threshold for the variance in percentage. If the threshold is exceeded, the line will be highlighted with a red color in the **Cost control** workspace. <br>Note: The same threshold in percentage applies for the current period and year.                       |

## Cost control workspace

The **Cost control** workspace is designed as a web report so that all managers who are responsible for a cost object can be granted access as described in Define access rights for cost object controllers. (link)

The lists of reports that are available for the end users, for example,managers, are controlled by the setting in the **Published** field on the **Cost control workspace configurations** page.

A manager can select the specific fiscal calendar period that he or she wants to see. The session date is used to determine the default current period.

The values in the fiscal calendar period are determined by the report name and the fiscal calendar selected for the cost accounting ledger associated the report name in Cost control workspace configuration.

In the cost object dimension hierarchy, the end user can select the aggregation level at which balances should be displayed. By enabling the access level security, you control the permissions so that the end users can only select the hierarchy levels and thereby see the aggregated balances that they have been granted access to.

### Add or remove columns

End users have the possibility to customize the columns in the specific report to fit into their needs.

### View details

End users can drill into the details behind the balances shown in the workspace. The dialog **Cost element details** display the detailed information of the **Cost element dimension hierarchy node** that is highlighted in the workspace prior to selecting **View details**.

A grid displays each cost element associated with the **Cost element dimension hierarchy node** and their values. The columns displayed in the grid match the workspace settings.

Two graphical visuals display a summary of **Actual vs Budget** and **Budget variance by period**

For example, Rent is an expenditure distributed to cost centers. If an end user would like to understand how the Rent cost that his/her cost center must carry, the user can drill down to see how it has been calculated.

By clicking the **Allocation base** button, the system will display a dialog where the allocation base is assigned to the rule and the corresponding statistical measures registered for the specific period will be displayed.

In the example shown below the **Allocation base** is of type **Formula allocation base** and the formula is displayed. The factors defining the formula is listed.

A grid shows the calculation performed per cost object.
