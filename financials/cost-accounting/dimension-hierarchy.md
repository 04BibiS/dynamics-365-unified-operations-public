# What is a dimension hierarchy?  

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
 
A logical tree structure that organizes the members of cost dimensions such that each member has one parent member and zero or more child members. The aggregated data at node levels show cost performance at any level of an organization. Dimension hierarchies are important for reporting because they let you define the reporting structure that fits into your organization.

Here is an example of a dimension hierarchy.
