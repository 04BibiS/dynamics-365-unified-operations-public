# Dimension hierarchy 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Dimension hierarchies are let you define the reporting structure that fits into your organization. Here is an example of how a dimension hierarchy can look like. In addition, dimension hierarchies let you define cost policies and set up security at different levels in your organization.

![A screenshot that displays a dimension hierarchy](./media/dimension-hierarchy.png)

You can create dimension hierarchies for the following dimension types.

-   Cost element dimensions

-   Cost object dimensions

-   Statistical dimensions

> [!NOTE]
> You can create multiple dimension hierarchies for the same dimension for different reporting purposes, but a dimension hierarchy can **only** be associated with one dimension. (confused)

## The difference between dimension categorization hierarchy and dimension categorization hierarchy

The dimension categorization hierarchy type is used for reporting purpose. It only supports the cost element dimensions. When you select this type,

-   a dimension member can be associated more than once in the hierarchy structure.

-   a cost element dimension member can be placed in different nodes by assigning a **Cost behavior** to the leaf node.

This dimension classification hierarchy type is used for defining rules and reporting purposes. It supports all dimensions, such as cost object, cost elements, and statistical dimensions. When you select this type, a dimension member can only be associated once in the hierarchy structure.

## Create a dimension hierarchy

Go to **Cost accounting** \> **Dimensions** \> **Dimension hierarchies**. Click **New** to select a dimension hierarchy type.

### Understand the hierarch structure

A dimension hierarchy consists of a tree structure with nodes and leaf nodes relationships.

-   A node can have 1: n sub nodes.

-   A node can’t have both subnodes and leaf nodes assigned.

-   A leaf node can only be assigned at the lowest level in the hierarchy.

-   A node can contain 1: n dimension member ranges.

-   You can insert IDs that don’t exist as dimension members. This makes your hierarchy resilient for the future.

**Examples**

A small company has the following organization structure.

![a diagram that shows the organization structure](./media/dimension-hierarchy-org.png)

A cost object dimension that represents all the cost centers in the organizations is structured as follows.

- Cost object dimension
- Cost centers

| Cost object dimension member    | Name                      |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| CC001                           | HR (should it be after assembly) |
| CC002                           | Finance                          |
| CC003                           | Tax (Needed?)                    |
| CC007                           | AR/AP (Needed?)                  |
| CC005                           | Assembly                         |
| CC006                           | Packaging                        |

A cost element dimension that represents all the cost elements in the organizations is structured as follows.

| Cost element dimension member   | Name                             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 10001                           | Electricity                      |
| 10010                           | Cleaning                         |
| 10011                           | Heating                          |
| 40001                           | COGS                             |

A dimension hierarchy that meets the organizational reporting requirements can be set up as follows.

A dimension hierarchy that meets the policy requirement can be set up as follows. What policy and why do I need this policy? The table doesn't render correctly!

####  Dimension hierarchy details 

| Dimension hierarchy name | Dimension     | Dimension hierarchy type name      |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Cost behavior            | Cost elements | Dimension classification hierarchy |

#### Dimension hierarchy

|               | Dimension member ranges |                     |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Nodes         | From dimension member   | To dimension member |
| Cost behavior |                         |                     |
|      Fixed cost   | 10001                   | 10011               |
|      Variable cost   | 40001                   | 40010               |


### Copy a hierarchy

You can copy a current dimension hierarchy as the starting point for the new dimension hierarchy. This can be useful if you want to compare the previous dimension hierarchy to the new dimension hierarchy.

#### Move up and down nodes

You can move up and down a node within its current level in the structure to rearrange the node order for reporting in the **Cost control** workspace.

Move a node to a new designated location in the hierarchy by selecting a target node. There are two ways to move a node: Move below and Move after. What is the difference between the two?

-   **Move below**

    Moves the highlighted node in the hierarchy from its current position and inserts it **under** the selected target node.

-   **Move after**

    Moves the highlighted node in the hierarchy from its current position and inserts it **after** the selected target node at its level of the hierarchy.

> [!NOTE] 
> The order of the nodes is not maintained when exporting data to Excel or Power BI because these tools use alphanumeric sorting order by default and you should manually rearrange the order.

## Define dimension hierarchies for reporting

A dimension hierarchy consists of an unlimited number of levels that are available in the **Cost control** workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create reports using **Excel** or **Power BI**, only the first 15 levels of the dimension hierarchies will be exported. This is because a fixed schema is required in Excel and Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> Dimension hierarchies are not date effective (?). Any changes made to a dimension hierarchy will be saved to the record immediately, so you **can’t compare** data before this date to after this date.

Dimension hierarchies are available in the following reporting tools. This ensures consistency in reporting structure.

-   Cost control workspace (Dynamics 365 for Operations client)

    -   Controlled by configuration

-   Cost control workspace (Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile application)

    -   Controlled by configuration

-   Microsoft Excel

    -   Provides the option to select specific dimension hierarchies per export
        definition

        -   One cost element dimension hierarchy (mandatory)

        -   One cost object dimension hierarchy (optional)

        -   One statistical dimension hierarchy (optional)

-   Microsoft Power BI

    -   All dimension hierarchies are available

When using Excel or Power BI for reporting, the dimension hierarchies are normalized and only the first 15 levels are exported. In case a hierarchy has more than 15 levels, these levels will not be exported. The normalized table contains a record per all dimension members in the hierarchy so an automated aggregation will take place. This ensures that the balances at any of the 15 available levels in the hierarchy are still correct.

| Cost object dimension hierarchy - level 1 | Cost object dimension hierarchy - level 2 | Cost object dimension hierarchy - level 3 | Cost object dimension hierarchy - level 4 | Cost object dimension hierarchy - level 15 |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Organization                              | Admin                                     | Finance                                   | CC002                                     |                                            |
| Organization                              | Admin                                     | Finance                                   | CC003                                     |                                            |
| Organization                              | Admin                                     | Finance                                   | CC007                                     |                                            |

| Organization                              | Production                                | Packaging                                 | CC005                                     |                                            |
| Organization                              | Production                                | Assembly                                  | CC006                                     |                                            |

### Update dimension hierarchies for reporting 

Over time, dimension hierarchies used for reporting in these tools discussed above will need to be updated.

You can update any dimension hierarchies by refreshing the client.

-   Cost control workspace (Dynamics 365 for Operations client)

-   Cost control workspace (Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile application)

Any updates in dimension hierarchies will be picked up every 24 hours by a pre-cached job. After refreshing the exported data, the updated dimension hierarchies are available in

-   Microsoft Excel

-   Microsoft Power BI

> [!NOTE] 
> To manually trigger a refresh of the dimension hierarchy cache, you can create a new export to Excel for the dimension hierarchy or hierarchies that need to be refreshed.

## Define dimension hierarchies for policies

Cost accounting consists of multiple policies where detailed rules are defined. The list below shows the policies for which you need to define one or more dimension hierarchies.

-   Cost behavior

-   Cost distribution

-   Cost allocation

-   Cost rollup

Dimension hierarchies make it easy create rules. You can leverage the aggregations of dimension members provided by dimension hierarchy levels to avoid creating rules for every single dimension member. In case you have overlapping rules, you must define specific rules, which will be considered by the system when performing the overhead calculation.

**Example: Define a cost behavior policy**

A new cost behavior policy is created, and appropriate dimension hierarchies are assigned.

Cost behavior policy

| Policy name   | Cost element dimension hierarchy | Cost object dimension hierarchy | Accounting currency |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Cost behavior | Cost behavior                    | Organization                    | USD                 |

Rules

| Cost element dimension hierarchy node | Cost object dimension hierarchy node | Fixed percentage | Fixed amount | Valid from | Valid to |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Fixed cost                            | Organization                         | 100,00           | 0,00         | 1/1/2017   | Never    |
| 10001                                 | Organization                         | 0,00             | 150,00       | 1/1/2017   | Never    |
| 10001 (Note 1)                    | Finance                              |                  | 50,00        | 1/1/2017   | Never    |
| Cost behavior or Variable cost (Note 2)     | Organization                         | 0,00             | 0,00         | 1/1/2017   | Never    |

- Note 1: The variable cost node is not required, if a cost is not classified as fixed cost, then it must be variable cost.

- Note 2: A detailed rule is created for the combination of cost element member 10001 and all cost object members aggregated under the hierarchy level Finance. (CC002, CC003, CC007)

The rules listed above demonstrate the flexibility provided by the dimension hierarchies. High-level rules can be defined to minimize maintenance and detailed rules can be defined to fit into a specific business objective.

Updates performed on dimension hierarchies that are used in rules will be brought forward automatically by the system.

In case a level of granularity in the rules are no longer required, the rule can be expired.

For example, a specific cost behavior rule for the cost object dimension hierarchy node Finance is no longer required. Click **Expire rule** to expire the rule.

| Cost element dimension hierarchy node | Cost object dimension hierarchy node | Fixed percentage | Fixed amount | Valid from | Valid to  |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Fixed cost                            | Organization                         | 100,00           | 0,00         | 1/1/2017   | Never     |
| 10001                                 | Organization                         | 0,00             | 150,00       | 1/1/2017   | Never     |
| 10001 (Note 1)                        | Finance                              |                  | 50,00        | 1/1/2017   | 20/1/2017 |
| Cost behavior or Variable cost (Note 2)| Organization                         | 0,00             | 0,00         | 1/1/2017   | Never     |

Any overhead calculation that is executed after January 20, 2017 will no longer consider this rule.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **Valid from** and **Valid to** fields are date and time effective. You can expire the rule and run a new overhead calculation on the same day.

## Dfine dimension hierarchies for security

Cost accounting data should be made available to all managers who are responsible for a reporting unit termed as a cost object or a set of cost objects.

Potentially, all managers will be able to access the high sensitive business data, for example, revenues and margins, it is important to secure that only the data that are relevant to them is displayed. You define dimension hierarchies to control data security.

-   This only applies when the dimension value selected in the **Dimension hierarchy** reference is a **Cost object dimension**.

-   Only one **Dimension hierarchy** per **Cost object dimension** can be enabled in the **Access list hierarchy**.

Dimension hierarchy details

| Dimension hierarchy name | Dimension    | Dimension hierarchy type name      | Access list hierarchy |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Organization             | Cost centers | Dimension classification hierarchy | **Yes**               |

A new FastTab **Users** are visible in the hierarchy designer and one or several **User ID**s can be inserted at each node in the hierarchy.

|              | **Users**        | Dimension member ranges |                     |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|

The Access list hierarchy settings are used to control data displayed in the following areas.

-   Cost control workspace (Dynamics 365 for Operation client)

    -   Data in forms used to drill through scenarios

-   Cost control workspace (Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile application)

    -   Balances in cards

-   Microsoft Power BI

    -   Data displayed in Power BI visualizations
