# Overview

This topic provides information on generic approach about setting up the Reverse Charge (RC) value-added tax (VAT) for European countries.
The EU concept of Reverse charge VAT is dedicated to simplify the trade within one single market. The Reverse Charge is a tax schema
which moves the responsibility for the accounting and reporting of a VAT transaction from the seller to the buyer of goods and\or services. Thus, the recipient of the goods and\or services reports both the output VAT (acting as a seller) and the input VAT (acting as a purchaser) in their VAT statement. 
EU Directive left space for Member State to determine on how to adopt the generic requirements to the local market needs. Thus, in some countries, the reverse charge schema is implemented only for certain goods and\or services, with additional condition to the amount\threshold of goods sold, and in others, the responsibility of which party is going to pay VAT depends on the status of the supplier and the buyer.
If the buyer is liable to pay VAT, it must be clearly reflected on the invoice issued by the supplier, i.e. a special wording ‘’Reverse charge” is included in the invoice along with indicating which positions are under Reverse charge.
