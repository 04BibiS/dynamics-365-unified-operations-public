## Description

You can set the duty identification (i.e. KU), description, Tax authority and accounts which will be used for posting: Duty account is a balance account in which the liability for the purchase duty is registered, Cost account is a Profit and Loss account to which the costs are posted and a Settle account.

To specify the purchase duty value, click the **Purchase duty value** button to open the **Purchase duty value** form. You can specify the purchase duty percent (i.e. 0,30) for required period.

Purchase duties will be generated during the sales tax Settle and post process. Purchase duty report can be generated from the **Purchase duty reporting** menu.
