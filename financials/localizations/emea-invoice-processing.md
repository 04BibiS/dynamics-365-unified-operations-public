# Invoice processing overview

The information below introduces changes in the Eastern European localization related to the customer and vendor invoice processing. These changes support country-specific legal requirements regarding to the filling and control of the dates that are important for tax reporting in those countries.

 - the sales date in customer invoices and the document receipt date in
   vendor invoices,  
 - the date of VAT register.

Also it provides a short description for some country-specific scenarios, for example, Intra-community VAT or Deferred tax.

|Scenario   |Applicable for countries   |Description of the functionality changes   |
|---|---|---|
|Accounts receivable and Accounts payable dates for VAT   |Czech Republic   | When the goods are purchased from the European Union countries, there is an obligation of self-assessment of VAT: <br>  - the output VAT must be paid in VAT period where the invoice has been issued (Document date),<br>  - the input VAT can’t be deducted before document receipt (VAT register date).<br>The following settings should be done to support this scenario:<br>  - enable ‘Intra-community VAT’ and ‘Document date for intra-community VAT’ in the Accounts payable parameters,<br>  - two sales tax codes: one with positive sales tax percentage and another with negative,<br>  - set up a sales tax group including both positive and negative sales tax codes. Negative sales tax code will have ‘Intra-community VAT’ parameter set to true.<br>In result a purchase will have two posted sales tax transactions:<br>  - a positive transaction with direction ‘sales tax receivable’ and VAT register date equals to the same date from the invoice posting window,<br>  - a negative transaction with direction ‘sales tax payable’ and VAT register date equals to the Document date. |
|Modify a sales document date   |All Eastern European countries   |You can modify the ‘Document date’ on a project invoice. This date is displayed in the printing form of invoice.
A Document date field has been added to the Posting invoice and Free text invoice forms. After you post an invoice, the ‘Document date’ is displayed in its header.   |
