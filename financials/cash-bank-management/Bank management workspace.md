# Bank management workspace

The Bank management workspace shows information that is related to company bank accounts. This workspace includes a Summary and Analytics view. The Summary view shows summary tiles, bank account information, a balance chart, and related information. The Analytics page uses the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI to show visuals that are related to bank account balances.

## Summary view


### Summary

The tiles in the Summary section give an overview of your bank accounts, and quick navigation to the pages you need to go to most often. The bank reconciliation information is specific to Advanced bank reconciliation functionality, and will only include information for those bank accounts with the **Advanced bank reconciliation** field set to **Yes** on the **Bank account** page. From the summary section you are able to import electronic bank files for bank accounts across all legal entities.

### Bank accounts

Each bank account in the legal entity is represented by a card in the Bank accounts section. The current balance is available, with a drill down to the transactions which make up that summary balance amount. The bridged transactions are any pending transactions that have been posted using bridging functionality, and have not yet been cleared. The **Bridged transactions** amount also has a drill
down to the transactions which make up that summary amount. The **Pending balance** is the current balance minus the bridged, or pending, transactions.

The card will also show when the bank account was last reconciled. This information is only shown if the bank account has Advanced bank reconciliation enabled.

### Balance

The Balance chart will show historic balance information for the bank account selected in the Bank accounts section, or summarized for all bank accounts in the legal entity. This is available for different periods of time: week, month, year, 5 years, and full history of the bank account. 

The balance chart will show the historic balances in the bank account currency if you are viewing it for a single selected bank account. The balance chart will show the historic balances in accounting currency if you are viewing it for all bank accounts in the legal entity.

Last updated information is shown at the top of the chart. You can refresh the data as needed.

### Related information

From **Related information**, you can navigate to the **General journal** page to complete bank transfers. You can also quickly navigate to the **Bank transactions** and **Bridged transactions** pages.

### Analytics view

The **Analytics** page provides important metrics about the bank accounts in the current company. The following visualizations are available on the page.

-   Total bank balance in system currency

-   Balance by legal entity

-   Today’s actual vs forecasted balance in bank account currency

-   Balance by bank account

-   Balance by currency

You can view bank analytics across all companies from the Cash overview – all companies workspace.
