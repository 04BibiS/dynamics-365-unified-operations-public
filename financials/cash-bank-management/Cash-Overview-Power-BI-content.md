# Cash overview Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the **Cash overview** Power BI content. This topic explains how to access the reports that are included in the content, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content pack.

## Overview

This content  was created for individuals who are responsible for cash within their organization. The **Cash overview** Power BI content provides visibility into your cash flow and provides forecasts that will enable better decisions leading to healthy cash flow. Cash can be analyzed by legal entity, currency, and bank account to get a better understanding of surpluses and short falls.

## Accessing the content pack

Reports from the **Cash overview** Power BI content  are  embedded within the **Cash overview** and **Bank management** workspaces in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

You can also find the **Cash overview** content in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/analytics/power-bi-content-microsoft-partners). You can also watch a demonstration of this process in [this Offcie Mix](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w).

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. These calculated measures are then used to calculate the charts and reports that are used in the Power BI content. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the Power BI file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content. After you've made modifications, you can create organizational content  and dashboards that contain the information that you’ve added.
