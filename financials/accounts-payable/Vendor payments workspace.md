# My Work

## Summary tiles

The **Summary** tiles give an overview of the state of your payment information. You can see payment journals that are not yet posted, 
invoices that are past due, all vendors, and vendors that are on hold. From the summary section, you can create a new pay run. 
This information is for the company that you are logged into.

## Vendor transactions tabular lists

In the **Vendor transaction tabular lists** section, a listing of the invoices past due and payments not settled are displayed. 
From the Invoices past due list, navigation to the settlement history for the selected invoice is provided. From the Payments not 
settled list, you can view the settlement history and settle the invoice using the actions located above the list.

Centralized payment clerks are provided with a filter at the top of the Vendor transaction lists that allows the selection of a 
company. The company is filtered to only those companies that are defined within the centralized payment organizational hierarchy 
that the centralized payment clerk has rights to view.

The **Find transactions** capability allows you to search for a vendor transaction.

## Related information

You can view the **Vendor aging** report and the **Payment summary by date** report by using the links provided in the Related 
information section of the workspace.
