# Expense management mobile workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the **Expense management** mobile workspace. This workspace lets users capture and upload a receipt, so that they can attach it to an expense report later, quickly create an expense line by using an attached receipt, or create and manage their expense reports. The **Expense management** mobile workspace alos lets approvers view and approve or reject expense reports assigned to them.

This mobile workspace is for use with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations mobile app.

## Overview

Many organizations require that a copy of a receipt be attached to a travel-related or business-related expense report that an employee submits for reimbursement. The **Expense management** mobile workspace lets users quickly create new expense lines on the mobile device of their choice by using an attached photo of a receipt. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a receipt and then attach it to an expense report later. Employees can also create and manage their expense reports and submit for approval and reimbursement using their mobile device (. 

Specifically, the **Expense management** mobile workspace enables a user to:

-   Take a photo of a receipt, and upload it to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. A user can then attach that photo to an expense report later.
-   Upload a file as a captured receipt. A user can then attach that file to an expense report later.
-   Create a new expense line by using an attached receipt. A user can then add the line item to an expense report later, and submit it for approval and reimbursement.
## Features available in Microsoft 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update
-   Create a new expense report.
-   Attach credit card transactions and other previously created expenses to an expense report.
