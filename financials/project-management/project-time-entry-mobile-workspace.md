# Project time entry mobile workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]



This topic provides information about the **Project time entry** mobile workspace. This workspace lets users enter and save time against a project by using their mobile device.

This workspace can be used with:
- The Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise Edition mobile app
- The Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app


Overview of the Project time entry mobile workspace
---------------------------------------------------

As part of their daily work, project resources are often on-site or traveling. The **Project time entry** mobile workspace lets users enter their billable or non-billable time against a project on the mobile device of their choice. Therefore, project resources can record time entries anytime and anywhere. They can also view time entries that have already been recorded. 

Specifically, the **Project time entry** mobile workspace provides these features:

-   For any selected date, enter the number of hours that you spent on a specific task.
-   Search by project name or customer to find the project to enter time for.
-   Specify the category and activity for the time that you spent.
-   Record the time as billable or non-billable for the project.
-   Optionally enter any external or internal comments.

## Prerequisites
The prerequisites differ based on the version of Dynamics 365 that has been deployed for your organization.

If Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise Edition July 2017 update has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator simply needs to publish the **Project time entry** mobile workspace. For instructions, see [Publish a mobile workspace](/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/publish-mobile-workspace).

If Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later has been deployed for your organization, the system administator must complete the following prerequisites.
