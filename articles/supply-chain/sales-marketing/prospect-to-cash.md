# Prospect to cash

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Prospect to cash solution provides direct synchronization across Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales. The Prospect to cash templates that are available with the Data Integration feature enable the flow of data for accounts, contacts, products, sales quotations, sales orders, and sales invoices between Finance and Operations and Sales. While data is flowing between Finance and Operations and Sales, you can perform sales and marketing activities in Sales, and you can handle order fulfillment by using inventory management in Finance and Operations.

In the current version, the Prospect to cash solution provides the following types of direct synchronization:

- [Maintain accounts in Sales and sync them directly from Sales to Finance and Operations](accounts-template-mapping-direct.md)
- [Maintain products in Finance and Operations and sync them directly to Sales](products-template-mapping-direct.md)
- [Maintain contacts in Sales and sync them directly to contacts or customers in Finance and Operations](contacts-template-mapping-direct.md)
- [Synchronize sales quotation headers and lines directly from Sales to Finance and Operations](sales-quotation-template-mapping-sales-fin.md)
- [Synchronize sales orders directly from Finance and Operations to Sales](sales-order-template-mapping-direct.md)
- [Synchronize sales orders directly between Sales and Finance and Operations](sales-order-template-mapping-direct-two-ways.md)
- [Synchronize sales invoice headers and lines directly from Finance and Operations to Sales](sales-invoice-template-mapping-direct.md)

In earlier versions, the Prospect to cash solution provides the following types of non-direct synchronization:

- [Maintain accounts in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations](accounts-template-mapping.md)
- [Maintain contacts in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations](contacts-template-mapping.md)
- [Maintain products in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales](products-template-mapping.md)
- [Create sales quotes in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations](sales-quotation-template-mapping.md)
- [Create sales orders in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales](sales-order-template-mapping.md)
- [Create sales invoices in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales](sales-invoice-template-mapping.md)
