You can use time windows to optimize the scheduling of service order lines. You
can set up the system so that it automatically creates service orders. Based on
the criteria specified by a time window, you can connect as many service order
lines as possible to as few service orders as possible.

Time windows specify how far a service order line can move from its calculated
date. The calculated date is the date when the service order line was scheduled
to occur. The date is based on its interval setting and the service period that
you defined in the Create service orders form. You define a time window by using
the values in the following table.

| Method | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Week   | The date that the service order line can be moved to any open day in the same week as the initial calculated date.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Month  | The date that the service order line can be moved to any open day in the same month as the initial calculated date. For example, the calculated date for a service order line is February 15, 2012. The service order line can be scheduled for any weekday between February 1 and February 28, 2012. |
| Manual | You define the maximum number of days before or after the initial calculated date that the service order line can be moved.                                                                                                                                                                           |

If you do not specify a time window for a service agreement line, the service
order line that is derived from the service agreement must be on the exact date
for which it was originally scheduled.
