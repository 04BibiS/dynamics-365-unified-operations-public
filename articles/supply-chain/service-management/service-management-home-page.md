# Service management 

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Use **Service management** to establish service agreements and service subscriptions, handle service orders and customer inquiries, and to manage and analyze the delivery of services to customers. You can use service agreements to define the resources that are used in a typical service visit. You can also use service agreements to view how those resources are invoiced to the customer. A service agreement can also include a service level agreement that specifies standard response times, and offers tools to record the actual time.

You can create service orders to manage information about scheduled and unscheduled visits by a service technician to a customer site. Service orders include information such as:

1.  The hours of work that the service technician will perform

2.  The type of service or repair

3.  The item to repair, including details about the symptoms and diagnosis

4.  Any expenses and fees related to the service or repair

Customers can submit service requests through the Internet by using the Enterprise Portal. You can receive, process, and dispatch these requests. After you have created a service order, you can use service stages to monitor progress and specify rules that control what actions are enabled in each stage. When a service order is complete, you can sign off on the order to confirm that it is complete, and then post the order to start the invoice process.

Use the reporting tools to monitor service order margins and subscription transactions, and print work descriptions and work receipts.
