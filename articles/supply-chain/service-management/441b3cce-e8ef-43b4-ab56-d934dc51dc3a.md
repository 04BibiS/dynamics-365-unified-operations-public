Subscriptions are based on a time-and-materials project. You can create
subscriptions from a project, from the Service subscriptions form, or by using a
service subscription group.

For each subscription, you can create an optional number of subscription fees.
The subscription fees are the transactions that you invoice to the customer.

A period code indicates the extent of the subscription fee period, or the
intervals at which the subscription should be invoiced.

The period code is defined in the service subscription group. It is defined for
the subscriptions through the service subscription group. Any new subscription
fee that you create has a suggested start date. This is the start date of the
period, if it is the first period that is created, or the end of the previous
period, if it is the second or later period.
