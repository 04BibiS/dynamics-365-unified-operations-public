# Working with customer service 




Customer service supports professional, service-based companies and manufacturing service organizations.

Customer service includes the following functionality:

  - Key processes for service management, such as service agreements, service orders, and return management

  - An advanced setup for repair management that includes tracking of repairs and versioning for bills of materials (BOMs)

  - Support for employee roles, such as service manager, dispatcher, and service technician or service consultant

  - Service subscriptions, which can generate periodic streams of revenue that are independent of the frequency of service

  - Service-level agreements that support a differentiated customer base
