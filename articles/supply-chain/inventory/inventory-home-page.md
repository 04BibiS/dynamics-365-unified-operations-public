You can use Inventory management for inbound and outbound operations, quality assurance, warehouse activities, and inventory control.

From the **Arrival overview** page, you can keep track of expected items and you can use arrival journals to register receipts. 
After items have arrived in the inbound dock, you can use pallet transports to guide the flow through the warehouse to the picking 
or the bulk location areas.

You can set up quality inspection and quarantine of products as an automated process by using quality associations or you can manually 
set products on hold in various stages of the order process cycle.

Process shipments for complete orders, parts of orders or a consolidation of multiple orders and create picking routes or pallet 
transports based on the contents of the shipment. You can use picking lists and output orders to ship items to production or to the 
distribution channels.

Inventory control includes the raw materials, work-in-process items, and finished items that a company has on hand for its own 
production processes or for sale to customers. As inventory is considered an asset, inventory accounting methods are used to create a 
valuation, which has impact on the amount of the expenses charged to the cost of goods in an accounting period, and therefore on the 
amount of income earned. With Inventory management and Cost management, you can define cost structure, define prices and price 
calculation, close inventory, adjust inventory, and recalculate inventory.
