# Adjust on-hand inventory cost values

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Cost management lets you handle the valuation and accounting of raw materials, semi-finished goods, finished goods, and work in progress assets. Cost management is the process of defining, managing, and reporting Inventory accounting and Manufacturing accounting.

Manufacturing accounting lets you handle **Job order costing** in production order and batch order and backflush costing in lean manufacturing.

You can define cost policies in the following areas. 
-	 Inventory accounting
-  Manufacturing accounting
-  Indirect cost accounting
-  Predetermined cost
-  Ledger integration

For example, you can define which inventory valuation methods, for example, **FIFO**, **Weighted average**, **Standard cost**, or **Moving average** you want to apply to products in **Item model group** in Inventory accounting.

You can use Inventory accounting and Manufacturing accounting from the **Cost administration** and **Cost analysis** workspaces. These workspaces provide a comprehensive overview of the current status, KPIs, and detection of deviation.
