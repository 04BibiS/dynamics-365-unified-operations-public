# Mobile barcode support

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Since Android is an open source project, any manufacturer of hardware for warehouse barcode scanners can build a device to run the Android operating system. A device is only Android compatible if it can run apps that are written for the Android execution environment.
However, a hardware vendor can modify and create overlays for the Android open source code that runs on their Hardware 
However each hardware vendor can modify and do overlayering of the Android version that runs on their hardware and Microsoft cannot take any responsibility, if the mobile barcode scanning app for Android is not compatible with a manufacturerâ€™s barcode scanning hardware and  the Android version that runs on it. 

The Warehouse app for Microsoft Dynamics 365 has been tested with a selection of Android powered devices for barcode scanning, but the tests do not include all devices that are available on the market.

As a customer, we recommend that you test the Warehouse mobile scanning app on selected hardware before you decide on the hardware you want to buy.
