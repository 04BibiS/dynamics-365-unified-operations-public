# Call center catalogs

[!INCLUDE [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the call center–specific functionality linked to the catalog capabilities in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.  

The catalog features found in Dynamics 365 for Retail can be used for multiple purposes.  Initially the catalog features were created to support 3rd party e-commerce integrations.  Catalog setup allowed companies to create a grouping of products and attributes that could be published externally for consumption by a 3rd party ecommerce solution.  

When call center channel support was added to Dynamics 365 for Retail, the same catalog concept was expanded to add additional capabilities for supporting and managing features related to traditional direct-to-consumer marketing catalogs.   A direct-to-consumer company will often produce printed catalogs which are then mailed to one or more segments of customers.  These catalogs will typically have specific promotions or offers that will only be honored if the customer provides a catalog identification code at the time of order creation. 

Direct to consumer marketing companies are very focused on tracking the response to these catalogs to ensure the costs to produce and mail them are justified. To track the response, a code is traditionally printed on the back of the catalog and this code is then requested and applied when the catalog recipient calls to place an order by phone (or now more traditionally the code may be entered when the customer places an order online).   While there are different industry terms that have been used to identify this catalog tracking code (key code, promo code, catalog code, source code, etc...), we refer to the code in Dynamics 365 for Retail as the **Source code ID**.

## Basic catalog setup

Navigate to **Retail** \> **Catalogs and assortments** \> **All catalogs** to configure your catalog.

When you create a new catalog, you must first link the catalog to one or more retail channels.  This is done in the **Retail channels** fast tab on the catalog setup form.  Use the **Add** function and select one or more retail channels.   Please note that only items linked to your selected channel(s) [assortments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/assortments) can be used when creating the catalog.

Adding products to a catalog requires choosing a navigation hierarchy, which will support the category structure for the catalog.  You must pick from one of the navigation hierarchies linked to the retail channels selected in the **Retail channels** fast tab of the catalog form. If a navigation channel was not linked to a channel previously, navigate to **Retail** \> **Channel setup** \> **Channel categories and product attributes** to link a navigation heirarchy default to each of your retail channels.

From the **CATALOGS** menu tab on the catalog setup form, use the **Add products** option to configure the products to add to the catalog, or select a node in the navigation heirarchy which will change the screen presentation and allow for the addition of products directly to a category within the catalog.

Click the top node of the catalog hierarchy at any time to return to the main catalog header view.  Configure effective and expiration dates as necessary on the **General** fast tab.  

Before the catalog is available to use, it must be published.  Use the **Validate catalog** action from the **CATALOGS** menu to process a validation.  This is required and will validate that all the required setup is accurate.  Use the **View results** action to see the details of the validation.  If errors are found, users must correct the data and run validation again until the validation has passed.  

After confirmed validation, the **Workflow** option on the menu should be utilized to kick off the approval workflow. Click **Submit** from the **Workflow** menu to execute the process.  Configure the steps and authorized users for the workflow from **Retail** \> **Headquarters setup** \> **Retail workflows**.  The workflow will define the steps needed to get the catalog into an **Approved** status.  Once the catalog is in an **Approved** status, users may click the **Publish** option from the **CATALOGS** menu to complete the process.  Once the catalog is in a **Published** status, it can be utilized in call center order entry and send catalog processes.

## Using catalogs to drive sales order pricing and promotions

A core reason for defining a catalog to use with the call center application is to be able to configure specific prices and promotions for that catalog.  Customers ordering from this catalog will receive these prices and promotions in call center order entry if the catalog's **Source code ID** is applied to the order header or lines.

To configure catalog specific prices, use the **Price groups** option from the **CATALOGS** tab to link one or more price groups to the catalog.  All trade agreements, price adjustment journals, and retail advanced discounts (threshold, quantity, mix and match) that have been linked to the same price group will be applied when customer's order from this catalog.

In the **Source codes** fast tab, use the **Add** action to add one or more **Source code ID** identifiers to this catalog.  This is the code that will be applied during call center order entry to the sales order header (and lines) that will link the sales order to the catalog and ultimately to the price group(s) and any special prices and promotions that have been configured.  

## Utilizing the source ID to track costs and response rates

When defining the **Source code ID**, you may optionally link this ID to a **Target market ID**.  The **Target market ID** can be defined in **Retail** \> **Customers** \> **Target market**.   The target market is a list of customers and/or prospects that belong to a user-defined segment.  Linking the customer or prospect data to the source code ID, allows for better visibility into the recipients of the catalog.  If a customer is linked to a target market and that target market is linked to an active source code ID/catalog, Dynamics users will be able to see what catalogs a customer has received by selecting the **Source codes** menu option in the **CUSTOMERS** menu tab on the **Customer service** form.   During order entry, call center users can also see the specific catalogs a customer was sent in the **Source** field drop down on the sales order header.  Changing the filter from **All** to **Targeted** will allow the user to see the specific active catalogs the customer was sent.  This is helpful in situations where the customer may have forgotten their catalog or can't locate or read the catalog code when they are calling in to create a sales order.

It is possible to link multiple **Source code ID**'s to a catalog.  This is often utilized if the company wants to track the response rate by different segments and will give a unique catalog code to different customer segments.  This allows for tracking the response rate down to the segment level within a particular catalog event.

Highlighting a particular **Source code ID** record and clicking the **Details** option in the **Source codes** fast tab will provide additional fields where sales projections, mailing costs, and mailing dates can be captured.  This data can all be helpful for doing detailed analysis on the effectiveness of the catalog.  Users can return to this form over time and use the **Source code analysis** and **Compare promotions** action buttons to trigger analytical reports based on current sales data and compare costs and budget to actuals.

## Configuring catalog specific order and item scripts 

When a call center user is creating a sales order, on-screen scripts can be shown to the user.  These text-based scripts may provide additional information that the user is to say to the customer, or it may be internal notes/reminders that the call center user should review and react to as they are creating the sales order.  

It is often helpful to have a different set of scripts for a particular catalog.  In the **Scripts** fast tab, pre-defined scripts can be linked to a catalog.  Use the **Timing** field to determine if the script will appear at the beginning of the order (as soon as the Source code ID is entered on the order header), or at the end of the order (in the sales order summary form).

When selecting a node in the catalog's hierarchy and working with the data in the **Products** fast tab, users may also link catalog/item specific scripts using the **Scripts** action.  

## Configuring catalog specific upsell and cross-sell items

Linking up-sell/cross-sell suggestions to an item can be done from the products setup, but in some cases, a company may wish to promote special up-sell/cross-sell items to customers ordering a specific product from a specific catalog.   From the **Products** fast tab, select an item and use the **Up-sell/cross-sell items** action to configure products to be up or cross-sold to customers who purchase the selected item from the catalog.   During call center order entry, catalog specific up-sell/cross-sell items will appear on screen instead of standard up-sell/cross-sell products that may have been configured for that item through the normal product configuration forms.

Up-sell/cross-sell items can also take advantage of the scripts features to show specific messages that a user will see when the up-sell/cross-sell item is displayed during order entry. Scripts tied to up-sell/cross-sell products configured specifically for a catalog product will only appear when that catalog's source code is applied in call center order entry.

## Catalog page analysis

Under the **CATALOGS** tab in the toolbar, options are available to configure **Catalog pages**.  This feature allows you to define specific pages and page types for the printed catalog and their associated costs.  

When configuring the products in the catalog, use the **Product page layout** action to define the specific page(s), percentage of page and position of page details for the item.  Configuring this data will allow users to take advantage of the **Catalog area analysis report**.   This report is found by navigating to **Retail** \> **Call center reports** \> **Catalog area analysis report**.  This report analyses sales placed against the catalog (sales orders where the source ID for the catalog was tied to the order header or line) and their associated percent of page and costs to give a traditional direct marketing **Square inch analysis** report.

## Catalog requests

As catalogs are configured and published in Dynamics 365 for Retail, the **Send catalog** feature can be utilized.  This feature is available on the **Customer search** form and the **Customer service** form.  After selecting a customer record through **Customer search** or while viewing a selected customers account from **Customer service**, users may select the **Send catalog** option which will open a dialog allowing the user to choose from a list of any published and active catalogs.  A user can select a catalog and a quantity, and a particular Source Code ID to send if desired and click the **Send** button.  This stores a request which can then be managed by printing the **Catalog requests report**.  This report is found by navigating to **Retail** \> **Call center reports** \> **Catalog requests report**.  This report lists all the catalog requests including the customer name and address details of the customer who requested the catalog.  This report can be used internally or the data transmitted to a 3rd party mail house to support external processes for physically sending the catalog to the customer.

## Additional features

From the **CATALOGS** tab, options for configuring a **Payment schedule** and **Free products** are also available.  If the **Source code ID** linked to the catalog is applied during call center order entry, the customer will be eligible for the free products or use of the specific catalog payment schedule(s) as defined.  If it's necessary to limit the customer to only being able to select from payment schedules linked to their catalog and not all active payment schedules in the system, the **Only allow catalog plans** checkbox can be selected for one or more of the **Source code ID**'s defined to enforce that limitation.

## Additional notes

Currently when a **Source code ID** is applied to a sales order in call center, it is used to drive prices, promotions, scripts and up-sell/cross-sell's that are catalog specific, but the system will not prohibit or prevent a product that is not in the catalog from being ordered on the sales order.  If an item is ordered that is not part of the catalog, the system will first look to the **Price group** defined on the call center channel (**Retail** \> **Channels** \> **Call centers** \> **All call centers**) for item price or promotions.  If no specific channel price is found, the base selling price of the item will be used.
