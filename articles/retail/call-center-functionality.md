# Call Center Overview

In Dynamics 365 for Retail, a Call Center is another type of Retail channel that can be defined in the application.   Defining a specific channel for your call center entities allows the system to tie some specific data defaults and order processing defaults to sales orders created by a user of the call center channel.

The call center feature of the Dynamics 365 for Retail product utilizes Retail features of Dynamics 365 such as advanced retail price and promotions, catalogs, gift cards, loyalty programs and coupons.  Call Center orders are also leveraged by our POS application to support cross-channel order fulfillment scenarios.

It is important to note that while the call center module can be utilized by other industries outside of Retail, the current release of the Dynamics 365 for Retail call center application has not been optimized for use in Business to Business (B to B) order processing scenarios, or scenarios where orders have a large amount of sales lines.   It is recommended that users who wish to utilize the call center features for order processing outside of normal Direct to Consumer (B to C or Direct) transaction processing take adequate time to test and validate that enabling call center functionality will meet your functional and performance needs.

In addition to supporting the order creation side, the call center module also provides a user-friendly customer service application that better allows users to locate customer accounts and review all of the related customer order data and attributes through a single workbench.  The customer service screen is designed to enable a user to quickly access order related data that will allow them to answer the most common order related questions received from customers.

This landing page provides links to relevant documentation and videos related to the setup, configuration and functional use of the call center features of Dynamics 365 for Retail.
