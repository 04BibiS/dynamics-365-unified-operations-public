# Shift and cash drawer management

[!INCLUDE [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and use the two types of retail point of sale (POS) shifts -  shared and stand-alone. Shared shifts can be used by multiple users in multiple places, whereas stand-alone shifts can be used by only one worker at a time.

There are two types of retail point of sale (POS) shifts: stand-alone and shared. Stand-alone shifts can be used by only one worker at a time. Shared shifts can be used by multiple users in multiple places. Therefore, they effectively create a single shift for multiple workers in a store.

## Standalone shifts
Stand-alone shifts are used in a traditional, fixed POS scenario, where cash is reconciled independently for each POS register. For example, in a grocery store setting, there are typically several fixed POS registers, and a cashier is assigned to each register. In this case, each register likely uses a stand-alone shift, and the cashier is responsible for the till or physical cash at that register. A stand-alone shift encompasses all the activity on that register during the cashier’s work shift. Activities can include the opening amount that is deposited in the till, all removal and addition of cash through operations such as bank drops and float entry, and the tender declaration at the end of the shift.

### Set up a stand-alone shift

A stand-alone shift is designated at the cash drawer level. This procedure explains how to set up a stand-alone shift on a POS register.

1.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS profiles** &gt; **Hardware profiles**.
2.  Select the hardware profile to use for the stand-alone shift.
3.  On the **Drawer** FastTab, confirm that the **Shared shift drawer** option is set to **No**.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **Registers**.
6.  Select the register that requires a stand-alone shift, and then click **Edit**.
7.  In the **Hardware profile** field, select the hardware profile that you selected in step 2.
8.  Click **Save**.
9.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedule**.
10. Select the **1090** distribution schedule, and then click **Run now** to synchronize changes to the POS.

### Use a stand-alone shift

1.  Sign in to the POS.
2.  If no shift is open, select **Open a new shift**.
3.  Go to the **Declare start amount** operation, and specify the amount of cash that is being added to the till to start the work day.
4.  Perform some transactions.
5.  At the end of the day, select **Declare tender** to declare the amount of cash that remains in the cash drawer.
6.  Enter the amount of cash, and then click **Save** to save the tender declaration.
7.  Select **Close shift** to close the shift.

**Note:** Other operations are available during the shift, depending on the business processes that are in place. The **Safe drop**, **Bank drop**, and **Tender removal** operations can be used to remove money from the till during the day or before the shift is closed. If a till runs low on cash, the **Float entry** operation can be used to add cash to the till.

## Shared shifts
A shared shift is used in an environment where multiple cashiers share a cash drawer or a set of cash drawers throughout the work day. Typically, a shared shift is used in mobile POS environments. In a mobile environment, each cashier isn’t assigned to and responsible for a single cash drawer. Instead, all cashiers must be able to tender a sale and add cash to whatever cash drawer is closest to them. In this scenario, the cash drawers that are shared among cashiers are included in a shared shift. All the cash drawers in a shared shift are included in the same shift for the purpose of activities that are related to cash management for that shift. Therefore, the starting amount for the shift should include the sum of all cash in all the cash drawers that are included in the shared shift. Likewise, the tender declaration will be the sum of all the cash in all the cash drawers that are included in the shared shift. **Note:** Only one shared shift can be open at a time in each store. Shared shifts and stand-alone shifts can be used in the same store.

### Set up a shared shift

1.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS profiles** &gt; **Hardware profiles**.
2.  Select the hardware profile to use for the shared shift.
3.  On the **Drawer** FastTab, set the **Shared shift drawer** option to **Yes**.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **Registers**.
6.  Select the register that requires a shared shift, and then click **Edit**.
7.  In the **Hardware profile** field, select the hardware profile that you selected in step 2.
8.  Click **Save**.
9.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedule**.
10. Select the **1090** distribution schedule, and then click **Run now** to synchronize changes to the POS.

### Use a shared shift

1.  Sign in to the POS.
2.  If the POS isn’t yet connected to a hardware station, select **Non-drawer operation**, and then select the **Select hardware station** operation to make a hardware station active for the shared shift. This step is required only the first time that a register is added to a shared shift environment.
3.  Sign out of the POS, and then sign back in.
4.  Select **Create a new shift**.
5.  Select **Declare start amount**.
6.  Enter the starting amount of all the cash drawers in the store that are part of the shared shift, and then click **Save**.
    -   To add part of the starting amount to each subsequent cash drawer, use the **Select hardware station** operation to make the hardware station active.
    -   To add a till to a specific cash drawer, use the **Open drawer** operation.
    -   Continue until all cash drawers in the shared shift have their part of the starting amount.

7.  At the end of the day, open each cash drawer, and remove the cash.
8.  After you’ve removed the cash from the last cash drawer, count all the cash from all the cash drawers.
9.  Use the **Declare tender** operation to declare the total amount of cash from all the cash drawers that are included in the shared shift.
10. Use the **Close shift** operation to close the shared shift.

## Shift operations
Various actions can be taken to change the state of a shift or to increase or decrease the amount of money in the drawer. The section below describes these shift operations for Dynamics 365 for Retail Modern POS and Cloud POS.

**Open shift**

POS requires that a user has an active, open shift to perform any operations that would result in a financial transaction such as a sale, return, or customer order.  

When logging into the POS, the system first checks to see if the user has an active shift available on the current register. If not, the user can then choose to open a new shift, resume an existing shift, or continue to login in “non-drawer” mode, depending on the system configuration and their permissions.

**Declare start amount**

This operation is often the first action that is taken a newly opened shift. Users specify the starting cash amount in the drawer for the shift. This is important because the over/short calculation that occurs when closing a shift accounts for this amount.

**Float entry**

Float entries are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift and they increase the amount of the cash in the drawer. A common example of a float entry would be to add additional change to the drawer when it is running low.

**Tender removal**

Tender removals are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift to reduce the amount of the cash in the drawer. This is most commonly used in conjunction with a float entry on a different shift. For example, Register 1 is running low on change, so the user on Register 2 performs a tender removal to reduce the drawer amount. The user on Register 1 would then perform a float entry to increase their amount.

**Suspend shift**

Users can suspend their active shift to free up the current register for another user, or to move their shift to a different register (this is often referred to as a “floating till”). 

Suspending the shift prevents any new transactions or changes to the shift until it resumed.

**Resume shift**

This operation allows a user to resume a previously suspended shift on a register that does not already have an active shift.

**Tender declaration**

The tender declaration is action the user takes to specify the amount of total money currently in the drawer, most often before closing the shift. This is the value that is compared against the expected shift to calculate the over/short amount.

**Safe drop**

Safe drops can be performed at any time on an active shift. This operation removes money from the drawer, so it can be transferred to a more secure location such as a safe in the back room. The total amount recorded for safe drops is still included in the shift totals, but doesn't need to be counted as part of the tender declaration.

**Bank drop**

Like safe drops, bank drops are also performed on active shifts. This operation removes money from the shift to prepare for the bank deposit.

**Blind close shift**

A blind closed shift is a shift that is no longer active but has not been fully closed. Blind closed shifts can't be resumed like a suspended shift, but procedures such as declare staring amounts and tender declarations can be performed at a later time or from a different register.

Blind closed shifts are often used to free up a register for a new user or shift, without having to fully count, reconcile, and close this shift first. 

**Close shift**

This operation calculates shift totals, over/short amounts, and then finalizes an active or blind closed shift. Closed shifts cannot be resumed or modified.  

**Manage shifts**

This operation allows users to view all active, suspended, and blind closed shifts for the store. Depending on their permissions, users can perform their final closing procedures such as tender declaration and close shifts for blind closed shifts. This operation will also allow users to view and delete invalid shifts in the rare event that a shift is left in a bad state after switching between offline and online modes. These invalid shifts do not contain any financial information or transactional data needed for reconciliation.
