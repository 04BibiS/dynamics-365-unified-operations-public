This sample shows how to create Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail extensions to integrate Retail Modern POS or Cloud POS with sales transaction digital signing service and Norwegian SAF-T reports. 

This sample is a part of the Retail software development kit (SDK). For information about how to install and use the Retail SDK, see the [Retail SDK documentation](./retail-sdk-overview.md).

This sample consists of extensions for the Commerce runtime (CRT), Retail Server (RS) and point of sale (POS). To run this sample, you must modify and build the CRT, RS and POS projects. We recommend that you use an unmodified Retail SDK to make the changes that are described in this topic. We also recommend that you use a source control system, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Online (VSO), where no files have been changed yet.

## Development environment

Follow these steps to set up a development environment so that you can test and extend the sample.

    > 
    > This part is similar to including SalesTransactionSignature CRT extension component, but uses different destination folder: *`bin`*  instead of *`bin\ext`*, this is required for successful loading of RS extension.

### The Modern POS extension components

#### Implement the proxy code for offline mode 

This part is equivalent to RetailServer controller but for local CommerceRuntime when the client is not connected

1. Change @(RetailServerLibraryPathForProxyGeneration) section of *`customization.settings`* to use the new RetailServer assembly for proxy generation

2. Implement following interface methods in the ***StoreOperationsManager*** class. For now, just add this:

    ``` csharp
    public Task<bool> SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReady()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    
    public Task<FiscalTransaction> GetLastFiscalTransaction(string storeNumber, string terminalId)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    ```

3. In order to regenerate the proxy code build the Proxies folder from command line (`msbuild /t:Rebuild`)

4. Open *`RetailSDK\Proxies\RetailProxy\Proxies.RetailProxy.csproj`*, add *`RetailSDK\SampleExtensions\CommerceRuntime\Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample\CommerceRuntime.Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample`* project to the solution and add a project reference to the ***RetailProxy*** project referencing ***SalesTransactionSignatureSample***

5. Implement interface methods in the ***StoreOperationsManager*** class correctly now.

    ``` csharp
    public Task<bool> SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReady()
    {
        return Task.Run(() => CommerceRuntimeManager.Runtime.Execute<SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReadyResponse>(new SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReadyRequest(), null).IsReady);
    }

    public Task<FiscalTransaction> GetLastFiscalTransaction(string storeNumber, string terminalId)
    {
        return Task.Run(() => CommerceRuntimeManager.Runtime.Execute<GetLastFiscalTransactionResponse>(new GetLastFiscalTransactionRequest(), null).FiscalTransaction);
    }
    ```

6. Update ***dllhost.exe.config*** so the ClientBroker will load new RetailProxy assembly
    ``` xml
        <add key="RetailProxyAssemblyName" value="Contoso.Commerce.RetailProxy" />
        <add key="AdaptorCallerFullTypeName" value="Contoso.Commerce.RetailProxy.Adapters.AdaptorCaller" />
    ```

#### Modern POS extensions components

1. Open the solution at ***RetailSdk\POS\ModernPOS.sln***, and make sure that it can be compiled without errors. Also make sure that Modern POS can be run from Microsoft Visual Studio using the **Run** command. (Modern POS must not be customized. You must enable User Account Control [UAC], and you must uninstall previously installed instances of Modern POS as required.)

2. Include existing ***AuditEventExtensionSample*** and ***SalesTransactionSignatureSample*** source code folders in the ***Pos.Extensions*** project.

3. Enable the extensions compiling in ***tsconfig.json*** by removing ***AuditEventExtensionSample*** and ***SalesTransactionSignatureSample*** folders from exclude list.

4. Enable the extensions loading in ***extensions.json*** by adding the following lines in the appropriate place.

    ``` json
    {
        "baseUrl": "AuditEventExtensionSample"
    },
    {
        "baseUrl": "SalesTransactionSignatureSample"
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Refer to ***readme.md*** instructions file in ***Pos.Extensions*** project for more details and samples how-to include source code folder and enable extensions loading

5. Rebuild the solution.

6. Run Modern POS in the debugger, and test the functionality.

### The Cloud POS extension components

1. Open the solution at **RetailSdk\POS\CloudPOS.sln**, and make sure it can be compiled without errors.

2. Include existing ***AuditEventExtensionSample*** and ***SalesTransactionSignatureSample*** source code folders in the ***Pos.Extensions*** project.

3. Enable the extensions compiling in ***tsconfig.json*** by removing ***AuditEventExtensionSample*** and ***SalesTransactionSignatureSample*** folders from exclude list.

4. Enable the extensions loading in ***extensions.json*** by adding the following lines in the appropriate place.

    ``` json
    {
        "baseUrl": "AuditEventExtensionSample"
    },
    {
        "baseUrl": "SalesTransactionSignatureSample"
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > Refer to ***readme.md*** instructions file in Pos.Extensions project for more details and samples how-to include source code folder and enable extensions loading

5. Rebuild the solution.

6. Run the solution using the **Run** command and following the steps in the Retail SDK handbook.

7. Test the functionality.
