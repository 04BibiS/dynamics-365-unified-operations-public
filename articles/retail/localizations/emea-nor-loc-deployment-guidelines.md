# Deployment guidelines for cash registers for Norway

This topic is a deployment guide that shows how to enable the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail localization for Norway. The localization consists of several extensions of Retail components. For examples, the extensions let you print custom fields on receipts, register additional audit events and sales and payment transactions in Point of Sale (POS), digitally sign sales transactions, and print X/Z reports in local formats. For more information about the Retail localization for Norway, see [Cash registers for Norway](./emea-nor-cash-registers.md).

This sample is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK). For information about how to install and use the Retail SDK, see the [Retail SDK documentation](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md).

This sample consists of extensions for the Commerce runtime (CRT), Retail Server, and POS. To run this sample, you must modify and build the CRT, Retail Server, and POS projects. We recommend that you use an unmodified Retail SDK to make the changes that are described in this topic. We also recommend that you use a source control system, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Online (VSO), where no files have been changed yet.

## Development environment

Follow these steps to set up a development environment, so that you can test and extend the sample.

### The CRT extension components

The CRT extension components are included in CommerceRuntime samples. To complete the following procedures, open the CRT solution, **CommerceRuntimeSamples.sln**, under **RetailSdk\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime**.

### The Retail Server extension components

#### SalesTransactionSignature Retail Server sample component

1. In the **RetailSDK\\SampleExtensions\\RetailServer\\RetailServer.Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample** folder, find the **RetailServer.Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample** project, and build it.
2. In the **RetailServer\\Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample\\bin\\Debug** folder, find the **Contoso.RetailServer.SalesTransactionSignatureSample.dll** assembly file.
3. Copy the assembly file to the **\\bin** folder under the IIS Retail Server site location.
4. Find the configuration file for Retail Server. The file is named **web.config**, and it's in the root folder under the IIS Retail Server site location.
5. Register the Retail Server extensions in the **extensionComposition** section of the configuration file.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.RetailServer.SalesTransactionSignatureSample" />
    ```

6. Register the dependencies of the Retail Server extensions:

        <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.SalesTransactionSignatureSample" />
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > Do **not** edit the commerceruntime.config file. This file isn't intended for any customizations.
        > 
        > This step resembles the step for including the SalesTransactionSignature CRT extension component, but it uses a different destination folder: bin  instead of bin\\ext. You must use the bin folder to help guarantee that the Retail Server extension is successfully loaded.

### The Modern POS extension components

#### Implement the proxy code for offline mode 

This part is equivalent to the Retail Server controller, but it extends the local CRT that is used when the client isn't connected.

1. Change the **@(RetailServerLibraryPathForProxyGeneration)** section of the **customization.settings** file to use the new Retail Server assembly for proxy generation.
2. Implement the following interface methods in the **StoreOperationsManager** class. For the first iteration, add the following code.

    ``` csharp
    public Task<bool> SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReady()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    public Task<FiscalTransaction> GetLastFiscalTransaction(string storeNumber, string terminalId)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    ```

3. To regenerate the proxy code, build the **Proxies** folder from the command line (**msbuild /t:Rebuild**).
4. Open **RetailSDK\\Proxies\\RetailProxy\\Proxies.RetailProxy.csproj**, add the **RetailSDK\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime\\Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample\\CommerceRuntime.Extensions.SalesTransactionSignatureSample** project to the solution, and add a project reference to the **RetailProxy** project to reference **SalesTransactionSignatureSample**.
5. Adjust the interface methods in the **StoreOperationsManager** class.

    ``` csharp
    public Task<bool> SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReady()
    {
        return Task.Run(() => CommerceRuntimeManager.Runtime.Execute<SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReadyResponse>(new SalesTransactionSignatureServiceIsReadyRequest(), null).IsReady);
    }
    public Task<FiscalTransaction> GetLastFiscalTransaction(string storeNumber, string terminalId)
    {
        return Task.Run(() => CommerceRuntimeManager.Runtime.Execute<GetLastFiscalTransactionResponse>(new GetLastFiscalTransactionRequest(), null).FiscalTransaction);
    }
    ```

6. Update the **dllhost.exe.config** file so that the client broker loads the new RetailProxy assembly.

    ``` xml
        <add key="RetailProxyAssemblyName" value="Contoso.Commerce.RetailProxy" />
        <add key="AdaptorCallerFullTypeName" value="Contoso.Commerce.RetailProxy.Adapters.AdaptorCaller" />
    ```

#### Modern POS extension components

1. Open the solution at **RetailSdk\\POS\\ModernPOS.sln**, and make sure that it can be compiled without errors. Additionally, make sure that you can run Modern POS from Microsoft Visual Studio by using the **Run** command.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Modern POS must not be customized. You must enable User Account Control (UAC), and you must uninstall previously installed instances of Modern POS as required.

2. Include existing **AuditEventExtensionSample** and **SalesTransactionSignatureSample** source code folders in the **Pos.Extensions** project.
3. Enable the extensions to be compiled in **tsconfig.json** by removing the **AuditEventExtensionSample** and **SalesTransactionSignatureSample** folders from the exclude list.
4. Enable the extensions to be loaded in **extensions.json** by adding the following lines in the appropriate place.

    ``` json
    {
        "baseUrl": "AuditEventExtensionSample"
    },
    {
        "baseUrl": "SalesTransactionSignatureSample"
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information, and for samples that show how to include source code folders and enable extensions to be loaded, see the `readme.md` instructions file in the **Pos.Extensions** project.

5. Rebuild the solution.
6. Run Modern POS in the debugger, and test the functionality.

### The Cloud POS extension components

1. Open the solution at **RetailSdk\\POS\\CloudPOS.sln**, and make sure that it can be compiled without errors.
2. Include existing **AuditEventExtensionSample** and **SalesTransactionSignatureSample** source code folders in the **Pos.Extensions** project.
3. Enable the extensions to be compiled in **tsconfig.json** by removing the **AuditEventExtensionSample** and **SalesTransactionSignatureSample** folders from the exclude list.
4. Enable the extensions to be loaded in **extensions.json** by adding the following lines in the appropriate place.

    ``` json
    {
        "baseUrl": "AuditEventExtensionSample"
    },
    {
        "baseUrl": "SalesTransactionSignatureSample"
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information, and for samples that show how to include source code folders and enable extensions to be loaded, see the `readme.md` instructions file in the **Pos.Extensions** project.

5. Rebuild the solution.
6. Run the solution by using the **Run** command and following the steps in the Retail SDK handbook.
7. Test the functionality.
