# Attributes, Attribute groups & their associations with various Retail entities in Dynamics 365. 

 **Attribute** provides a way to further describe a product and its characteristics through user defined fields (examples: memory size, hard disk capacity, Is Energy star compliant etc.). In Dynamics 365, attributes can be associated with various retail entities such as Product Categories and Retail Channels, and default values can be set on them. Products inherit the attributes and the default values upon their association with the Product Categories or Retail Channels. The default values can be overridden at the product level: at the individual product level, at retail channel level, or in retail catalog.
 
*Example for a typical TV product there could be following attributes*

| **Category   | Attribute                | Permissible Values       | Default Value** |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| TV & Video | Brand                    | Any valid Brand value    | (None)        |

## Attribute types

*Attributes* are based off **Attribute Types**. The **Attribute Type** identifies the type of data that can be entered for a specific attribute. The following attribute types are currently supported in the Dynamics 365:

-	**Currency** – Supports currency value. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**DateTime** – Supports date and time value. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**Decimal** – Supports numerical value including decimals. It also supports unit of measure. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**Integer** – Supports numerical value. It also supports unit of measure. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**Text** – Supports text value. It also supports a predefined set of possible values (aka Enumeration).
-	**Boolean** – Supports binary value (true / false).
-	**Reference** – References other attributes.

## How-to set up attribute types in Dynamics 365

## Attribute metadata
Attribute metadata allows you to select the options that indicate how the attributes for each product should behave. 

For example, you can select whether attributes are required, whether they can be used for search, and whether they can be used as a filter. For retail products, the attribute metadata settings can be overridden at the channel level, we will learn later in this article about it. 

As you may notice, on the attribute form there's a dedicated section for the Attribute metadata. Of the available properties, the property that affects the behavior or treatment of the attribute values by the system on Retail Point of Sale is **"Can be refined"**. 
Upon setting the value to be "Yes" for "Can be refined" only those attributes show up for refinement or filtering of products on Point of sale. 

The remaining properties in attribute metadata - 


	- Searchable,
	- Retrievable,
	- Can be queried,
	- Sortable,
	- Allow multiple values,
	- Ignore case & format, and
	- Complete match 
  
  Purpose of these propoerties can be understood here [Overview of SharePoint search ](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219669.aspx "Overview of SharePoint search")

These were originally intended for improving search for online store-front. With Dyamics 365, although we don’t ship that Online Store out of the box but we ship **eCommerce Publishing SDK** which is used by the customers to put products into a Search Index of their choice. While the data is imported it is still good idea to let our customers distinguish between searchable, queryable, and so on so they could build optimal index to make sure they index only those attributes which *in their opinion* should be indexed. 

## Filter settings for Attributes 
Filter settings for attributes allows user to define how the filters for attributes gets displayed on the Retail point of sale. 
These filter settings are accessible from the attribute definition page in Dynamics 365. 

Refiner display preferences it has the following elements-
	1. Name: 
	2. Display option:
	3. Display control:
	4. Threshold Value

**Name**: Editable textbox, but contains name of the attribute by default.  

**Display option**: This has the following two options:

	a) Single value
		- Enabled for the following attribute types: Boolean, Currency, Decimal, Integer, and Text. 
		- Single value selection enabled on the client.
	b) Multi value
		- Enabled for the following attribute types: Currency, Decimal, Integer, and Text.
		- Multi-value selection enabled on the client.
		
**Display control**: This has the following 4 options:
	a) List
	b) Range 
	c) Slider
	d) Slider with bars  (P2)
	 
	• List 
		○ Enabled for the all attribute types:
		
	• Range 
		○ Enabled for the following attribute types: Currency, Decimal, and Integer.
		○ Single or Multi value selection enabled on the client
		
	• Slider and Slider with bars
		○ Enabled for the following attribute types: Currency, Decimal, and Integer.


**Threshold values** is required for the display control type Range. Values for it can be defined using ";" (semi-colon) as a delimiter. 

For e.g. in case of 'Bag Volume' refiner a threshold value can be
 10; 20; 50; 100; 200; 500; 1000; 5000. 

For the above values point of sale, will show the following ranges and grey out the ranges which do not have any products in the result set.
	- Less than 10
	- 10 – 20
	- 20 – 50
	- 50 – 100
	- 100 – 200
	- 200 – 500
	- 500 or more

## Attribute group 
An attribute group is used to group the attributes for a component or subcomponent in a product configuration model. This can help a person configure a product, because the selections are arranged in a certain context. Once attributes have been defined, they can be grouped under **Attribute Groups**. Attribute Groups provide grouping of individual attributes and can be assigned to retail categories or retail channels. An attribute can be included in more than one attribute group. 

You can also set default values for selected attributes that are included in the attribute group. For example, if you add an attribute for color to an attribute group, you can select the color ***Blue*** as the default attribute value. When the attribute group is added to a retail product that includes a color as one of its attributes, the color ***Blue*** is displayed as the default color for that product. 

![Attribute Groups](media/AttributeGroup.png)


## How-to Steps: Attribute groups
- Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager 
- Go to Product information management > Setup > Categories and attributes > Attribute groups
- Create a new attribute group: *Fashion Sunglasses*
- Add attributes: *Lens shape, Sunglass brand*


## Assign attribute groups to Retail categories

One or more attribute groups that can be associated with category nodes in the following types of retail category hierarchies: Retail product hierarchy, Channel navigation category hierarchy, and Supplemental product category hierarchy. Products will inherit the attributes, which are included in the attribute groups, upon their categorization.


![Retail product hierarchy product attribute Groups](media/AGRetailProdHierarchy.PNG)


## How-to Steps – Assign attribute groups to Retail categories
-	Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager 
-	Go to Retail > Category and product management > Retail product hierarchy
  -	Click on “Fashion navigation hierarchy”.	
  -	Select category “Pants” under Menswear and add attribute group “Men’s belt” under Product attribute group tab.
  -	Select category “Fashion sunglasses” and verify new attributes in “Fashion Sunglasses” attribute group by clicking view attributes.
  [Note: It should show the newly added attributes Lens shape, Sunglass brand.]
  - Select category “Pants” under Menswear and verify attributes for “Men’s belt” attribute group by clicking view attributes
  [Note: It should show Men’s belt attributes: Men’s belt brand, Belt fabric, and Belt size.]

  [Note: The aforementioned approach can be used to assign attribute groups to categories in Channel navigation category hierarchy, and Supplemental product category hierarchy as well:
- Retail > Category and product management > Channel navigation categories
- Retail > Category and product management > Supplemental product categories]


## Assign attribute groups to Retail stores

One or more attribute groups that can be associated with one or more Retail stores in the retail stores hierarchy. Products will inherit the attributes, which are included in the attribute groups, when they are enriched for specific retail stores.


## How-to Steps – Assign attribute groups to Retail stores
- Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager 
- Go to Retail > Channel setup > Channel categories and product attributes
