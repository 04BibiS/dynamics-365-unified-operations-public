# Attributes, Attribute groups & their associations with various Retail Entities in Dynamics 365. 

 **Attribute** provides a way to further describe a product and its characteristics through user defined fields (examples: memory size, hard disk capacity, Is Energy star compliant etc.). In Dynamics 365, attributes can be associated with various retail entities such as Product Categories and Retail Channels, and default values can be set on them. Products inherit the attributes and the default values upon their association with the Product Categories or Retail Channels. The default values can be overridden at the product level: at the individual product level, at retail channel level, or in retail catalog.
 
*Example for a typical TV product there could be following attributes*

| **Category   | Attribute                | Permissible Values       | Default Value** |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|

## Attribute types

*Attributes* are based off **Attribute Types**. The **Attribute Type** identifies the type of data that can be entered for a specific attribute. The following attribute types are currently supported in the Dynamics 365:

-	**Currency** – Supports currency value. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**DateTime** – Supports date and time value. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**Decimal** – Supports numerical value including decimals. It also supports unit of measure. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**Integer** – Supports numerical value. It also supports unit of measure. It can be bounded (supports a value range) or can be left open.
-	**Text** – Supports text value. It also supports a predefined set of possible values (aka Enumeration).
-	**Boolean** – Supports binary value (true / false).
-	**Reference** – References other attributes.

## How-to set up attribute types in Dynamics 365 

*	Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager	
* Go to Product information management > Setup > Categories and attributes > Attribute types
	Create a new attribute types of type Text and with Fixed list:
  *	Lens shape (Values: Oval, Square, Rectangle)
  *	Sunglass brand (Values: Ray ban, Aviator, Oakley)

## Attribute metadata
As you may notice, on the attribute form there's a dedicated section for the Attribute metadata. It allows you to define the characteristics around how the system may treat the values of the attribute. 

Of the mentioned properties, the actual property that affects the treatment of the attribute values by the system on Retail Point of Sale is "Can be refined". Upon setting the value to be "Yes" for "Can be refined" only those attributes show up for refinement on Point of sale. 

Actual purpose of the remaining properties in attribute metadata - 


- Searchable,
  - Retrievable,
  - Can be queried,
  - Sortable,
  - Allow multiple values,
  - Ignore case & format, and
  - Complete match 
  
  can be understood here [Overview of SharePoint search ](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219669.aspx "Overview of SharePoint search")

These were originally intended for improving search for online store-front. With Dyamics 365, although we don’t ship that Online Store out of the box but we ship **eCommerce Publishing SDK** which is used by the customers to put products into a Search Index of their choice. While the data is imported it is still good idea to let our customers distinguish between searchable, queryable, and so on so they could build optimal index to make sure they index only those attributes which *in their opinion* should be indexed.

## Attribute group 
Once attributes have been defined, they can be grouped under **Attribute Groups**. Attribute Groups provide grouping of individual attributes and can be assigned to retail categories or retail channels.

## How-to Steps: Attribute groups
- Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager 
-	Go to Product information management > Setup > Categories and attributes > Attribute groups
-	Create a new attribute group: *Fashion Sunglasses*
-	Add attributes: *Lens shape, Sunglass brand*


## Assign attribute groups to Retail categories

One or more attribute groups that can be associated with category nodes in the following types of retail category hierarchies: Retail product hierarchy, Channel navigation category hierarchy, and Supplemental product category hierarchy. Products will inherit the attributes, which are included in the attribute groups, upon their categorization.


----Add screenshot for Retail product hierarchy showcasing Product attribute groups----

## How-to Steps – Assign attribute groups to Retail categories
-	Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager 
-	Go to Retail and commerce > Category and product management > Retail product hierarchy
  -	Click on “Fashion navigation hierarchy”.	
  -	Select category “Pants” under Menswear and add attribute group “Men’s belt” under Product attribute group tab.
  -	Select category “Fashion sunglasses” and verify new attributes in “Fashion Sunglasses” attribute group by clicking view attributes.
  [Note: It should show the newly added attributes Lens shape, Sunglass brand.]
  - Select category “Pants” under Menswear and verify attributes for “Men’s belt” attribute group by clicking view attributes
  [Note: It should show Men’s belt attributes: Men’s belt brand, Belt fabric, and Belt size.]

  [Note: The aforementioned approach can be used to assign attribute groups to categories in Channel navigation category hierarchy, and Supplemental product category hierarchy as well:
- Retail and commerce > Category and product management > Channel navigation categories
- Retail and commerce > Category and product management > Supplemental product categories]


## Assign attribute groups to Retail stores

One or more attribute groups that can be associated with one or more Retail stores in the retail stores hierarchy. Products will inherit the attributes, which are included in the attribute groups, when they are enriched for specific retail stores.


## How-to Steps – Assign attribute groups to Retail stores
- Login to Dynamics 365 back-office client as a Retail Merchandising Manager 
- Go to Retail and commerce  Channel setup  Channel categories and product attributes

- Enable the attributes to be available in the “Houston” channel
- Click on Set attribute metadata on the action pane.
	- In the Metadata form:
	- Select category node “Fashion” and for each of the attributes under the “Channel product attributes” fast tab, check / select “Include attribute”.
