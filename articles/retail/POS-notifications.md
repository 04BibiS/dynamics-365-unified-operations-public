# Display
notifications in Point of Sale

 

In today's modern
retail environment, the store associates are assigned various tasks such as
helping customers, ringing transactions, performing stock counts, receiving
orders in store etc. Our Point of Sale (POS) clients empower the associates to
do these and much more, all in a single application. With various tasks to be
performed during a day, there was a need to notify the associates, whenever
something requires their attention. The notification framework in the POS
solves this problem by allowing the retailers to configure role based
notifications. With the App update 5, monthly release of Dynamics 365 for
Retail, the notifications can be configured for the POS operations only.
Currently, the system provides the capability to display notifications for
Order fulfillment operation, however, the framework is designed to be
extensible, so that, in near future, the developers will be able to write
notification handler for any operation and display the notifications on POS.  

 

## Enable the
notifications for order fulfillment operation

 

To enable the
notification for the order fulfillment operation, follow the below steps:

* Navigate to
Operations form - Retail > Channel setup > POS setup > POS >
Operations

* Search for the
Order fulfillment operation and select the "Enable notifications"
checkbox for this operation. This indicates to the notification framework to
listen to the handler for the Order fulfillment operation. If the handler is
implemented, then the notifications will be displayed on POS, else, the
notifications will not be displayed for this operation.

* Navigate to the
"POS permissions" associated with the workers and under the
"Notifications" fast tab, add the Order fulfillment operation with
the "Display order" as 1. When there is more than one notification
configured, the display order is used to arrange the notification from top to
bottom with 1 being on top. Only those operations can be added for which the
"Enable notifications" checkbox has been checked. Also, the
notifications will be displayed only for the operations that have been added
here and only to those workers for whom the operations have been added to the
corresponding POS permissions. 

 

Note:
Notifications can be overridden at the user level by navigating to the worker's
record and selecting "POS Permissions" then editing that user's
notification subscription.

 

* Navigate to the
functionality profile form - Retail > Channel setup > POS setup> POS
profiles > Functionality profiles and update the "Notification
interval" property, to set the interval in minutes, at which the
notifications should be pulled. We recommend to set this value to 10 minutes to
avoid unnecessary communication to the headquarters. Setting the notification
interval to "0" will turn off notifications.  

* Navigate to
**Retail**>**Retail IT**>**Distribution schedule**. Select schedule
"1060-Staffs" to synch notification subscription settings and then
click **Run now**. Next, synch the permission interval by selecting
"1070-Channel configuration" and then click **Run now**. 

 

## Viewing
notifications in POS

 

Once the above steps
are complete, the workers, for whom the notifications are set up, can view the
notifications in POS. To view the notifications, click on the notification icon
in the title bar of the POS; this opens up a notification center with the notifications
for Order fulfillment operation. The notification center should display three
groups within the order fulfillment operation namely "Pending
orders", "Store pickup" and "Ship from store". 

 

* Pending orders -
This group displays the count of orders which are in the pending state i.e.
orders which need to be accepted by a POS worker, having the required
permissions, for store fulfillment. Clicking the number on the group will open
the order fulfillment form, filtered to display only the pending orders
assigned to the store for fulfillment. If the orders are auto accepted for the
store, then the count for this group will be zero.

 

* Store pickup -
This group displays the count of orders which have the delivery mode of
'Pickup' and the pickup is scheduled from the current store. Clicking the
number on the group will open the order fulfillment form, filtered to display
the active orders which are set up to be picked from the current store.

 

* Ship from store -
This group displays the count of orders which have the delivery mode of
'Shipping' and the shipping is scheduled from the current store. Clicking the
number on the group will open the order fulfillment form, filtered to display
the active orders which are set up to be shipped from the current store.

 

Whenever there are
new orders assigned to the store for fulfillment, the notification icon will
change to indicate new notifications and the count of the corresponding groups
will be updated. The user can also click on the refresh icon, next to the operation
name, to immediately update the count of the groups, else, the count will be
updated at the predefined interval. Any group which has a new item, which is
not seen by the current worker, will display a burst icon indicating this group
has a new item. Clicking on the tiles within notifications will open the
specific operation for which that notification is configured. In the above
cases, clicking on the notifications will open the order fulfillment page and
pass the appropriate parameters (Pending, store pickup and ship from store). 

 

Note: Pending orders
notifications will be enabled in a hotfix after AppUpdate 5 ships.
