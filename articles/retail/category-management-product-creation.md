# Product category management

[!include[banner](./includes/banner.md)]

Merchandising managers can use Retail product categories to manage relationships between Retail product hierarchy and released product details. To view product categories, in the **Category & product management**  workspace, select **Retail product hierarchy** to open the **New structure of Retail product category** page.

Product properties are divided into basic product properties and Retail product properties, based on the scope of their applicability. Retail product properties are *global*, which means that for a given product property, the same value is shared across all legal entities. Basic product properties are *legal entityâ€“specific*. In other words, a given product property might differ across legal entities, based on individual business requirements.

For product properties in the Retail product category, the fields are separated based on their applicability within a group, to reflect the released product details form structure.

You can switch between managing legal-entity specific properties across all legal entities and managing them for a specific legal entity. To do this, select either **View/Edit for all legal entities** or **View/Edit for a specific legal entity**.

Merchandising managers can also define default values for an additional set of product properties at the individual category level. These property values are inherited by a product, based on their association with a category at the time of product creation. These inherited product properties can be modified for each product, to meet individual business requirements.

## Select properties to update products

You can use logical grouping properties to select which updated product properties should be pushed to associated products.
