## Inventory lookup on POS 


Inventory lookup on POS helps retailers achieve real-time operational excellence and insights by connecting stores, POS, and the back office. It provides an accurate real-time view of products inventory across stores and distribution centers. It also helps retailers drive additional efficiencies and cost savings by improving inventory planning in real time. 

An accurate real-time inventory view across an organization helps store-associates to provide timely, elevated customer service. The moment that matters most is when the customer is ready to make a purchase decision. It's important for real-time inventory information to be at the fingertips of cashiers in the store, to empower cashiers to be able to accurately promise product delivery and pick up. 

Go to the **Retail Modern POS** workspace or **Retail Cloud** POS workspace to open the **Inventory lookup** page.

The **Inventory lookup** page allows you to enter a product on the numeric keypad so you can view quantity on hand for multiple stores and warehouses.

There are also values shown for **Reserved** and **Ordered** for each location. 

 - **Reserved quantity** - Refers to the Physical reserved value from back office for a product number at the given location.

 - **Ordered quantity** - Refers to the Ordered in total value from back office for a product number at the given location. 

### Locations for which inventory availability information is shown

The locations list is comprised of two types of entities:

 - **Retail stores** - This is the list of stores that are configured using the **Store-locator group** for the current store in the headquarters. 

- **Distribution centers** - These types are configurable in Dynamics 365 for Retail but we show inventory availability information only for the **Standard/Default type** of Distribution centers.

> Inventory availability information is not displayed for in POS for Transit, Quarantine & GoodsInRoute_RU type of warehouses.

On the **Inventory lookup** page, in addition to the current quantity on hand, reserved, and ordered, the future available to promise (ATP) quantities can be viewed for each store. To do view this information, select the store that you want to view the ATP for and then click **Show store availability**.

There are various kind of variant tiles, as noted in the following table.
