On inventory look-up page Along with quantity on-hand, you shall also notice there are the values shown for **Reserved** and **Ordered** for each location. 

**Reserved quantity** refers to *'Physical reserved'* value from back-office for an entered product number at the given location.

**Ordered quantity** refers to *'Ordered in total'* value from back-office for an entered product number at the given location. 

**Whatâ€™s the nature of locations for which inventory availability information is shown? **

The locations list comprises of two types of entities - **Retail stores** & **Distribution centers**. 

**Retail stores** are configured using **store-locator group**. That means, it shows only store locations that are part of a store-locator group of the current store. 

And of various types of **Distribution centers** that are configurable in Dynamics 365 for Retail - we show inventory availability information only for the **Standard/Default type** of Distribution centers. *(Note - We do not show inventory availability information in POS for Transit, Quarantine & GoodsInRoute_RU type of warehouses.)*

On inventory look up page, in addition to the *current quantity on hand, reserved & ordered*, the future **available to promise (ATP) quantities** can be viewed for each individual store. To do so, select the store that you want to view the ATP for and then click **Show store availability**.
