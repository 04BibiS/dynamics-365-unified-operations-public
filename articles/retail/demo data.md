# Using example screen layouts and sizes in MPOS/CPOS

This topic provides information about screen layouts for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail point of sale (POS) experiences.

## Overview

The example screen layouts included with Dynamics 365 for Retail provide content optimized for various segments of retail, store workers, and devices.  A single layout can contain several layout sizes and button grid combinations to ensure coverage as store workers transition between devices and stations.  This document will outline the differences between these layouts, the operations they provide, and the overall experiences they deliver.

## Anatomy of a screen layout ID

To find screen layouts in Dynamics 365 for Retail, navigate to **Retail > Channel setup > POS setup >POS > Screen layouts**.

<!-- Insert Fig 2.1 here -->

Screen layout IDs allow a maximum of 10 characters.  We use three pieces of information to build the string for a given ID.

[Company] + [Layout version] + [Persona]



## Layout sizes


## Companies and brands


## User sign in matrix


## Reference icons and images
