# Configuration steps for Retail developers working on Cloud-hosted development boxes

Because the developer cloud VMs will do not have admin access to the VMs, MPOS development will not be possible in these VMs. You have to use Cloud POS. Before starting the development for any retail application, configure Cloud POS as follows:

1. Open the Visual Studio and click **View** > **Application Explorer**. Wait for 15 seconds for IIS Express to start with all the retail websites deployed. You should see the IIS tray icon in the task bar with all the retail websites like Cloud POS and Retail Server running.
4. To debug CRT/RS extensions, attach the CRT/RS project to the IISExpress process.
5. When you open the Cloud POS project from the Retail SDK you may get the Configuration IIS Express failed with the following error: 
    ```
    Filename: redirection.config
    Error: Cannot read configuration file
    ``` 
    To mitigate this issue, follow these steps:
    a. Close Visual Studio.
    b. Rename the **%userprofile%\Documents\IISExpress\config** folder.
    c. Start Visual Studio again with the Cloud POS project. The **%userprofile%\Documents\IISExpress\config** folder will be recreated with the default config files.
    d. Copy the original **applicationhost.config** file over the autogenerated one from the folder that you renamed.
