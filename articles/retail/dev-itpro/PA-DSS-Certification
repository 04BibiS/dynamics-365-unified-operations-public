# All PA-DSS certification listings for Microsoft Dynamics

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 is implemented and the PA-DSS certification has not been completed yet by Microsoft, there is potential impact to the retailer's PCI audit and certification.  Specifically, until the PA-DSS certification is complete for the associated version, PCI certification can become more difficult and involved as the Payment Application may come into scope of testing during the certification.

This topic explains the past, current, and pending listings of PA-DSS certification for Microsoft Dynamics.  To view the current certifications direction, please visit [PCI PA-DSS certified payment applications](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/payment_applications).
