**Run Retail POS Samples:**

We added lot of sample projects in Retail SDK to help you with the extensions. This topic helps you to understand how you can enable and run the POS samples. This topic is applicable for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations or Dynamics 365 for Retail platform update 8

Letâ€™s include the sample extensions from Retail SDK in the POS.App project and load the extension.

**Follow the below steps to execute to the POS samples:**

1.  Open the ModernPos.Sln from Retail SDK\\POS.

2.  Select POS.Extensions project in the ModernPos solution and click Show All Files.

3.  Right click the SampleExtensions folder and select Include in Project.

4.  Open the extensions.json file and update it with Store samples, so that POS during runtime will include this extension.

```Typescript
 {

 "extensionPackages": [

 {

 "baseUrl": " SampleExtensions"

 },

 {

 "baseUrl": " SampleExtensions2"

 }

 ]

 }
```
**Note:** In the extension.json you should have minimum two extension folder names like above, this known issue for now. If you add only one extension folder in the file then POS will not load the extension.

1.  If you want to include multiple samples, update the extension.json file with all the sample information.

    Ex:
```Typescript
 {

 "extensionPackages": [

 {

 "baseUrl": "StoreHoursSample"

 },

 {

 "baseUrl": " SampleExtensions"

 },

 {

 "baseUrl": " SampleExtensions2"

 }

 ] }
```
**Note:** The baseUrl value should exactly match the relative path and extension folder name.

1.  Open the tsconfig.json to comment out the extension package folders from the exclude list. POS will use this file to decdei whether to compile or not compile the extension. By default, the list may contain the sample extensions list, if you want to compile any extension part of the POS then you need add the extension folder name and comment the extension from the extension list like below.

    To include the sample exteniosn comment it from the exclude list like below:
```Typescript
 {

 "extends": "../tsconfigs/tsmodulesconfig",

 "exclude": [

"AuditEventExtensionSample"

, "B2BSample"

,"CustomerSearchWithAttributesSample"

,"FiscalRegisterSample"

,"PaymentSample"

,"PromotionsSample"

,"SalesTransactionSignatureSample"

// ,"SampleExtensions"

// ,"SampleExtensions2"

//,"StoreHoursSample"

,"SuspendTransactionReceiptSample"

],

 "compilerOptions": {

 // There is a strange behavior for TypeScript 2.2.2 in map and source roots generated in compiled JS and map files. The following may change in future TypeScript versions.

 // In case there is only one top level extensions folder with .ts files included, the following two root directories need to be changed to include the extensions folder.

 // For example, change both roots to "./SampleExtensions" if "SampleExtensions" folder is the only top level folder that has .ts files included in the project.

 // That is, either "SampleExtensions" folder is the only top level folder, or all other top level folders have .js files only, no .ts files.

 "mapRoot": "./", /* Cannot be specified in base file. Adds full path to ".map" in the js file to enable debug in VS. */

 "sourceRoot": "./" /* Cannot be specified in base file. Adds full path to ".ts" in the map file to enable debug in VS. */

 }

}
```
 If you want to enable other extension, comment it from the exclude list like below:

 Ex: If you want also include B2BSample, follow the steps previously mentioned plus comment it from the exclude steps:
```Typescript
 "exclude": [

 "AuditEventExtensionSample"

 // ,"B2BSample"

 ,"CustomerSearchWithAttributesSample"

 ,"FiscalRegisterSample"

 ,"PaymentSample"

 ,"PromotionsSample"

 ,"SalesTransactionSignatureSample"

// ,"SampleExtensions"

// ,"SampleExtensions2"

//,"StoreHoursSample"

 ,"SuspendTransactionReceiptSample"

 ],
```
 **Note:** Other extension package folders even though not included in the Visual Studio project should be kept in the exclude list if they are not meant to be included.

1.  Click Save all and hit F5 to validate the extensions.

    **Note:** Set the solution platform to x86 and deploy option as Local Machine or Simulator.
