**Commerce Runtime services:**

Commerce runtime (CRT) is a collection of portable .NET libraries that contain the core business logic for the retail channel and pricing functionalities, if you want to add or modify any business logic then you should customize CRT. The Retail POS call the CRT to perform any business logic, CRT process the request and then sends the response back to POS. POS is like a thin client, all the business logic should be done in CRT.

Each CRT service contains one or more Request/Response, CRT service is a group of request and response. Anything you do in POS it sends Request to Retail server (RS) and RS call CRT, CRT process the request and sends the response back.

In this topic we see some important request/response which you may customize for your business scenario.

**There are three main layers in CRT:**

1.  Services

2.  Workflow and Messages

3.  Data Access

Other core components which is required for CRT to function are runtime, authentication, data access managers and avoid any customization on these layers because all business logic customization can be done in services, data access or at workflow level.

**Overall flow:**

CRT Service Request < > Zero or more workflow Request < > Zero or more Data Access Request

**Ex:** Create sales order service request will call multiple workflow and data access request to perform the request.

**CRT Services:**

Each CRT service contains one or more Request/Response. Ex: **Customer service** in CRT contains all the customer related and each one is executed in different flow.

You can use sales tax information from Microsoft Dynamics AX or from a third party sales tax service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For extension scenarios you can override any of the request inside the service class. Ex: If you want to change the customer search flow then you will extend the CustomersSearchServiceRequest from the CustomerService.

Note: You will not customize the Service class you will extend the request/response within the service class, service class by itself doesnâ€™t have any logic it just routes the call to the right request.

**Sample service class implementation:**

```C#
public class MyService : IRequestHandler

{

/// <summary>

/// Gets the collection of supported request types by this handler.

/// </summary>

public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes

{

get

{

return new[]

{

typeof(MyRequest),

typeof(MyRequest1),

typeof(MyRequest2),

};

}

}

/// <summary>

/// Entry point to my service. Takes a service request and returns the result

/// of the request execution.

/// </summary>

/// <param name="request">The my service request to execute.</param>

/// <returns>Result of executing request, or null object for void operations.</returns>

public Response Execute(Request request)

{

if (request == null)

{

throw new ArgumentNullException("request");

}

Type requestType = request.GetType();

Response response;

if (requestType == typeof(MyRequest))

{

response = MyRequestCustomMethod((MyRequest)request);

}

else if (requestType == typeof(MyRequest1))

{

response = MyRequest1CustomMethod ((MyRequest1)request);

}

else if (requestType == typeof(MyRequest2))

{

response = MyRequest2CustomMethod ((MyRequest2)request);

}

else

{

throw new NotSupportedException(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Request '{0}' is not supported.", request.GetType().ToString()));

}

return response;

}

private static MyResponse MyRequestCustomMethod (MyRequest request)

{

return myresponse;

}

}
```
**Extension pattern for CRT:**

1.  Create a new service class and implement one or more request/response â€“ Follow this approach if you want to create new feature.

2.  Override the core request/response - If you want to modify the standard workflow or business logic.

3.  Add pre or post trigger for any request/response â€“ If you want to add additional business logic or add some custom fields etc.

Note: It doesnâ€™t matter whether you create a data request, workflow request or service request everything in CRT is request and response. Itâ€™s up to you write whatever logic within the request/response. As said earlier the request are classified into different types for logical reasons but from the framework perspective everything is same.

**All our request/response will have the below three classes implemented:**

1.  **Request class** â€“ POS/RS/E-commerce/CRT workflow class the request to perform something.

2.  **Response class** â€“ Returns the response based on the request to the caller.

3.  **Handler class** â€“ Contains the core logic for the request. Within the handler class you can call other request, do custom logic etc.

**Request class:**
```C#
public class MyRequest : Request

{

/// <summary>

/// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="MyRequest"/> class.

/// </summary>

public MyRequest ()

{

}

// other properties

}

**Response class:**

public sealed class MyResponse : Response

{

/// <summary>

/// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=" MyResponse"/> class.

/// </summary>

public MyResponse ()

{

}

}

**Handler class:**

public sealed class MyRequestHandler : SingleRequestHandler< MyRequest, MyResponse >

{

/// <summary>

/// Saves (updating if it exists and creating a new one if it does not) the shopping cart on the request.

/// </summary>

/// <param name="request">The request.</param>

/// <returns><see cref=" MyResponse "/> object containing the cart with updated item quantities.</returns>

protected override MyResponse Process(MyRequest request)

{

//logic class.

}

}
```

### **Workflow**

On top of the services layer is the workflow layer. A workflow is a collection of services and business logic that together define business processes. For example, when a customer adds an item to the cart, you could use workflow to get the price, perform validation, check inventory quantity, calculate shipping, calculate tax, and calculate discounts. You can customize the existing workflows, or you can create new workflows. You can even use a workflow to connect to a third-party system as part of your business processes.

Just like services, workflow uses the request and response pattern. The request object inherits from the base commerce runtime [Request](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.dynamics.commerce.runtime.messages.request.aspx) class. The response object inherits from the base commerce runtime [Response](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.dynamics.commerce.runtime.messages.response.aspx) class. A workflow also has a request handler class that extends the [WorkflowRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj764791.aspx) class. To create a workflow, you create a request class and a response class, and then create a request handler class that contains the business logic for your workflow.

Ex: When you create a cash & carry transaction or customer order we perform lot of different steps or workflow before creating the order. One of the workflow steps in the order process is to Save Cart. Save cart request workflow is the one responsible for saving any changes done to the cart from POS. Ex: When you add item to cart, change quantity etc. anything you do in POS will call the SaveCart to save the changes to the POS and DB.

The Save cart workflow process will have the below three classes implemented:

**Request class:**
```C#
public class SaveCartRequest : Request

{

/// <summary>

/// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="SaveCartRequest"/> class.

/// </summary>

public SaveCartRequest()

{

}

// other properties

}

**Response class:**

public sealed class SaveCartResponse : Response

{

/// <summary>

/// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="SaveCartResponse"/> class.

/// </summary>

public SaveCartResponse()

{

}

}

**Handler class:**

public sealed class SaveCartRequestHandler : SingleRequestHandler<SaveCartRequest, SaveCartResponse>

{

/// <summary>

/// Saves (updating if it exists and creating a new one if it does not) the shopping cart on the request.

/// </summary>

/// <param name="request">The request.</param>

/// <returns><see cref="SaveCartResponse"/> object containing the cart with updated item quantities.</returns>

protected override SaveCartResponse Process(SaveCartRequest request)

{

//logic class.

}

}
```
All our workflow classes will follow the same pattern.

**Default Workflows and Handlers:**

Below is the list of default workflow request which been called one more service based on the operation you perform in POS. You can customize any of these workflows according to your business scenario:

**Orders:**
