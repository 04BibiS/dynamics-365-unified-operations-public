# Code and environment update procedures for Retail projects

An environment can be updated by either updating its data or its code.  

There are multiple ways to update the data. For good examples about how to get data into an environment, see NAME OF TOPIC. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/dataentities/data-entities-data-packages 

Moving the entire database should also be considered when updating an environment. It’s a quick and easy way to duplicate the data from one environment to another. 

Other kinds of updates are code updates. The LCS environment page keeps track of which updates have been applied and what updates need to be applied. The following image shows an environment with 79 outstanding X++ fixes and 14 outstanding binary updates and 9 outstanding platform updates.

Platform code is very low-level and there is no Retail-feature that is implemented in the platform. This means, that stand-alone Platform binary updates will not require any Retail-specific code to be retested.  Examples of features that are implemented in the platform are Data Import and Export Framework (DIXF) and the batch framework. 

Binary updates or hotfixes include DLLs, scripts, channel SQL schema changes and more. All channel-side hotfixes are shipped with a binary update/hotfix. Because they are DLLs, binary updates are cumulative. If you download a binary update on Friday, you automatically get all binary hotfixes from Monday – thru Thursday.   

The version of a binary hotfix taken is exactly the version of the Retail Sdk’s Microsoft-version.txt file (assuming the code merging has been done correctly). Binary updates are tied to (usually) the latest platform too. So, you will have to stay up-to-date with the platform when taking binary updates. The platform updates increase stability of the platform, but it impacts build environments and test efforts to some extent.

Application updates or hotfixes delivered in X++ source code. Therefore, they are not for the channel, but for the client side.  

Note that some updates require both an application and a binary update. See the next section for hotfix recommendations.  

Third-party packages are similar to application packages but developed by others. More information about ISV package usage can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/dev-tools/manage-runtime-packages 

The two main ways to update an environment are more detailed below.


### Updating data by restoring the database 

A useful and common operation is to move the entire database from one environment to another. This may be moving the production database to development environments when preparing to develop additional features. It could also be used to move the golden setup database to the production database as part of the go-live process.  

Whatever the reason, every time a database from a different environment is restored there are certain “links” in the database that may be broken.  The Environment reprovisioning tool fixes all these broken links for the default database group. It does not matter what type of environment is used. The general guideline is that if the database comes from a different server, the Reprovisioning tool must be run. 

The details about how to run this are outlined in: 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/database/copy-databasefrom-azure-sql-to-sql-server. 

The Reprovisioning tool should be run when the binary version of the target and destination database is the same. If that is not the case, either a build + dbsync (development environment) or deployment should also be done (sandbox, production).   

In many cases, the Retail scheduler should be reset whenever a database is being updated. 

After restoring the database, follow these steps:  

1. Build + db sync or deployment of the deployable package. 
> Note: If you have table extensions with data, you must have the metadata for these in the environment. If you do not, you may lose data as columns and tables may get dropped.  
2. Make sure batch service is running. 
3. Run the Environment reprovisioning tool (latest from global shared asset library, LCS/Maintain to deploy). 
4. Verify that the tool succeeded, verify that the Retail channel profile is up-to-date with the correct URLs, and that the data sync jobs for the Default data group succeeded.
5. In Finance and Operations, run “Initialize Retail Scheduler” to delete old data. This assumes that all CDX configuration changes are automated with the help of a resource file. If that is not the case, and tables, sub jobs, and jobs are manually created in the Retail channel schema, do not select the deletion of existing configuration. We reccomend that you automate this. See the development section for more details.

### Taking updates frequently  

If your project is further than a few weeks from go-live or the final UAT, we reccomend that you take all hotfixes (binary, X++ and platform) on a regular schedule. Doing this once a month is reccomended. In fact, the more often that you do this, the less issues occur as the code churn of the hotfixes is smaller. It will take substantially less time than 8 hours if you do this frequently. 

We do not suggest trying to pick and choose hotfixes, as this is more error-prone and likely not worth your time. If you have a count of 1000 or even 500, you should ask yourself if you are ready to go-live. You will get a more quality product if your LCS update tile count is very low (application fixes < 100, binary fixes < 10).   

After taking new hotfixes, the results of a previous UAT become less meaningful. It would be beneficial to retest, as this is dependent on the number of files that changed.  However, if hotfixes are being taken often, especially during the implementation phase, the number of new files is not too large.   

Another possible approach is to take all hotfixes frequently and only run part of all UATs.  The next time that new hotfixes are taken, a different part of UAT is run, in a circular fashion.  Before going live, a full UAT should be run. 



### Updating development environments 

You should always deploy binary updates and platform updates using LCS’s package deployment. 

You can sync the metadata folder and do a full build and database sync, so you do not have to deploy Finance and Operations packages.  However, it is also possible to deploy Finance and OPerations packages via LCS.  

If new Retail changes have been checked in, especially if the Retail SDK has been updated from a new binary update (and code merged), use LCS’s package deployment to deploy the retail package. Continued development does not require a package deployment after that. 

### Updating build environments 

You should always deploy binary updates, and platform updates using LCS’s package deployment. 

Finance and Operations and Retail customization packages should not be deployed to a build environment. 

### Updating Tier 2+ environments 

All packages should be deployed using LCS’s package deployment. The order should be platform or binary with platform, then Finance and Operations, and then Retail. 

### Comparing LCS tile counts 

Environments that should be at the same version level, should also have the same LCS tile counts.  If the tile counts are different, this may be caused by any of the following reasons: 

- The same deployable packages have not been deployed/applied and therefore the versions are different. 
- The scheduled task that collects the version information from an environment has not run yet. For development environments you can force the schedule task “LCSDiagnosticsCollector” to run. 
- The build environment’s application update counts do not match because X++ packages are not deployed on them. Binary and platform counts should be correct. 

It may be okay that some environments are on different versions. For example, if a developer works with the next version but the rest of the team is still working with a different release. Or, one development environment could have been kept on an older version in case a production hotfix needs to be developed (if the production environment uses older version as current development efforts). 


### Moving to a new version 

If you want to upgrade to a new version (such as 7.2 to 7.3, or 7.3 to 8.0), you must deploy a new environment and target the new version.  If applicable, you also need to run a code upgrade and a database upgrade.
