# Payment integration with payment terminal
This topic describes how to write a payment integration for the Dynamics 365 for Retail Modern POS (MPOS) for a payment terminal that can directly communicate with the payment gateway.

## Key Terms
| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Payment Connector | Extension library written to integrate the MPOS with a payment terminal. |
| Payment Processor | Extension library written to retrieve merchant propeties used by the payment connector. |

## Overview
The diagram below provides a high level overview of the payment terminal integration through the MPOS. Note, the diagram assumes that a local Hardware Station is used to communicate with the payment terminal but the same patterns apply to the shared Hardware Station as well.

This article describes the following steps that are required to create an end-to-end payment integration for a payment terminal:
- **Write a payment connector**: The payment connector is the main integration point between the MPOS and the payment terminal. This section describes how to implement a new payment connector that can relay payment requests (e.g. authorize, refund, void) to the payment terminal. 
- **Write a payment processor**: The payment processor is used to define the merchant properties used as part of the payment integration. This section describes how to implement a new payment processor, including interfaces to implement and patterns to follow.
- **Configure the payment connector in the Hardware Station config**: This section describes how to configure the new payment connector to be loaded by the Hardware Station (local or shared).
- **Configure the payment connector on the AX POS hardware profile form**: The `POS hardware profile` form in the AX client is where all payment related configuration properties are set for the end-to-end payment integration to work. This section describes how to configure the payment connector on the Hardware Station page.

## Write a payment connector
This section describes how to write a new payment connector.

### Understanding the payment flows
The following diagram illustrates a high level overview of several payment flows (i.e. Begin Transaction, Update Cart Lines, Authorize, Capture, End Transaction) across the MPOS, Hardware Station, and payment connector.

### Implement a payment connector
The section below describes how to implement a new payment connector. The examples shown below can be found in the `PaymentDeviceSample` class located under `SampleExtensions\HardwareStation\Extension.PaymentSample` folder in the Retail SDK.

#### Implement the INamedRequestHandler interface
All MPOS payment related flows are handled through request/response patterns in the Hardware Station. The first step in writing a new payment connector is to create a class that implements the `INamedRequestHandler` interface defined in the `Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Framework` library.

``` csharp
public class PaymentDeviceSample : INamedRequestHandler
{
    private const string PaymentTerminalDevice = "MOCKPAYMENTTERMINAL";

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the specify the name of the request handler.
    /// </summary>
    public string HandlerName
    {
	      get
        {
            return PaymentDeviceSample.PaymentTerminalDevice;
        }
    }
}
```

The `HandlerName` is used to configure the payment connector used on a given MPOS register through the AX client (desccribed below).

#### Implement supported payment requests
In order to process payment related flows the payment connector has to define the `SupportedRequestTypes` that it can handle. Additionally, the `Execute` method has to be implemented to route each of the requests supported by the connector to a given method. The example below shows the complete list of `SupportedRequestTypes` and an example of a specific request (i.e. `Authorize`).

``` csharp
public class PaymentDeviceSample : INamedRequestHandler
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the collection of supported request types by this handler.
    /// </summary>
    public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes
    {
        get
        {
            return new[]
            {
                typeof(OpenPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(BeginTransactionPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(UpdateLineItemsPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(CancelOperationPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(CapturePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(VoidPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(RefundPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(FetchTokenPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(EndTransactionPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(ClosePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest),
                typeof(ActivateGiftCardPaymentTerminalRequest),
                typeof(AddBalanceToGiftCardPaymentTerminalRequest),
                typeof(GetGiftCardBalancePaymentTerminalRequest),
                typeof(GetPrivateTenderPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest)
            };
        }
    }
    
        /// <summary>
    /// Executes the payment device simulator operation based on the incoming request type.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="request">The payment terminal device simulator request message.</param>
    /// <returns>Returns the payment terminal device simulator response.</returns>
    public Response Execute(Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages.Request request)
    {
        ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");

        Type requestType = request.GetType();

        if (requestType == typeof(AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest))
        {
            return this.AuthorizePayment((AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest)request);
        }
        else if (...)
        {
            ...
        }

        return new NullResponse();
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Authorize payment.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="request">The authorize payment request.</param>
    /// <returns>The authorize payment response.</returns>
    public AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceResponse AuthorizePayment(AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest request)
    {
        ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");

        PaymentInfo paymentInfo = Utilities.WaitAsyncTask(() => this.AuthorizePaymentAsync(request.Amount, request.Currency, request.VoiceAuthorization, request.IsManualEntry, request.ExtensionTransactionProperties));

        return new AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceResponse(paymentInfo);
    }
}
```

#### Full list of supported requests
The list below descibes all supported requests types that a payment connector can implement.

| Request Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **OpenPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called before a sales transaction is initiated to establish a connection to the payment terminal. | 
| **BeginTransactionPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when a new sales transaction is initiated to handle any initialization on the payment terminal (e.g. initializing transaction screen). | 
| **UpdateLineItemsPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when line items on the cart are updated. | 
| **AuthorizePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when a payment is initiated on the MPOS payment view. | 
| **CancelOperationPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when a user hits the "cancel" button on the payment view dialog after the payment is initiated but before the payment is completed on the payment terminal. | 
| **CapturePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called for each payment line when the entire amount on the cart is paid and before the sales transaction is concluded. | 
| **VoidPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when a payment line is voided on the cart. | 
| **RefundPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when a refund is issued. | 
| **FetchTokenPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called to fetch a payment token to support deferred payments for customer orders. | 
| **EndTransactionPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called when the sales transaction is concluded and all payments have been captured. | 
| **ClosePaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | Called after the sales transaction is concluded to close the connection to the payment terminal. | 
| **ActivateGiftCardPaymentTerminalRequest** | Called when an external gift card is being activated through the MPOS. | 
| **AddBalanceToGiftCardPaymentTerminalRequest** | Called when a balance is being added to an external gift card. | 
| **GetGiftCardBalancePaymentTerminalRequest** | Called to when the balance on the gift card is being retrieved. | 
| **GetPrivateTenderPaymentTerminalDeviceRequest** | TODO (add more details). | 

#### State in the payment connector
The payment connector can be either hosted as part of the `dllhost.exe` process when hosted through the in-proc Hardware Station inside the MPOS or as a `w3wp.exe` process when hosted in the IIS based Hardware Station. In either scenario there are circumstances under which each of these processes can be terminated or crash in between or in the middle of payment flows. As a result, it is recommended that payment connectors do not have state dependencies and can recover if terminated at any point in time during the payment flow related requests described above.

## Write a payment processor
Payment processes are usually used only if a direct connection to a payment gateway is established as it is most commonly the case in card-not-present sales transactions or more involved card-present scenarios. Additionally, the payment processor is also used to process the merchant properties configured through the `POS hardware profile` form in the AX client. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The payment processor is required today even if all payment requests are handled directly through the payment terminal and no merchant properties need to be set through the MPOS.
