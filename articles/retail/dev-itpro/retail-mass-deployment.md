# Mass deployment of Retail self-service components

This topic explains how you can use self-service to do silent servicing updates, initial deployments, and some aspects of special deployment. This topic will be updated as the feature is developed and more functionality becomes available. Currently, only the capability for silent servicing updates is available.

## Delimiters for mass deployment
The following table shows the delimiters that can currently be used in execution commands for mass deployment. These delimiters apply to App update 3 and later.

| Delimiter                 | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| -S or -Silent             | Silently run the installer. (No graphical user interface is used.) |
| -C or -Config             | Specify the location and file name of the configuration file to use as part of this installation. |
| -FilePath                 | Specify a custom installation location. (We don't recommend that you use this delimiter for a standard installation.) |
| -LogFile                  | Specify a custom log file location for the installation logs. (We don't recommend that you use this delimiter for a standard installation.) |
| -SkipPrerequisiteCheck    | Skip the check for prerequisites and prerequisite installation.  You should use this delimiter only for development and testing. (We don't recommend that you use this delimiter for a standard installation.) |
| -SkipSystemInfoCollection | Skip the process of collecting system information at the beginning of the installation. You should use this delimiter only for development and testing. (We don't recommend that you use this delimiter for a standard installation.) |
| -SkipMerchantInfo         | Skip the installation of merchant account information at the end of the self-service installer for Hardware station. You should use this delimiter only for development and testing. (We don't recommend that you use this delimiter for a standard installation.) |

## Silent servicing
### Before you begin
This functionality works in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail. The July 2017 version with Application update 3 or later is required. Note that silent servicing maintains all components that are currently installed. If any configuration is still required, please complete this prior to following the directions explained in this article.

### Examples of commands for silent servicing
This section shows examples of commands for self-service mass deployment. The commands that are shown work for all the standard self-service installers. These installers include Retail Modern POS (both the installer with offline support and the installer without offline support), hardware station, and Retail Store Scale Unit.

#### Silently update the current installation of Retail Modern POS
The following command silently updates the current installation of Modern POS. It has the standard command structure that is used for silent servicing of currently installed components. The structure uses the basic values of **InstallerName.exe** and the command for silent installation, **-S**. This command uses the configuration file that is located in the same file location as the installer, if a configuration file exists there.

```
ModernPOSSetup_V72.exe -S
```

> [!NOTE]
> A configuration file is still required for Retail Store Scale Unit. However, the installer still keeps all possible values that are currently installed.

#### Silently update the current installation of Retail Store Scale Unit
The following command silently updates the current installation of Retail Store Scale Unit by using a specific configuration file. (E.g. This configuration file might not be in the same location as the executable file for the installer.) This command skips the prerequisite check and continues to the installation steps. We recommend that you use this command only for testing and development purposes.

```
StoreSystemSetup_V72.exe -S -C "C:\Temp\StoreSystemSetup_V72_Houston.xml" -SkipPrerequisiteCheck
```

## Retail Modern POS mass deployment
### Before you begin
This functionality works in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail. The December 2017 version (Major release version 7.3.1) with App Update 1, or later, is required.  It is assumed that all stores, registers, devices, and other configurations in headquarters have already been completed. If any configuration is still required, please complete this prior to following the directions explained in this article.

It is important to note that devices should only be configured for mass deployment only right before they are deployed and activated.  Once the activation is complete, it is important to verify that no remaining devices are still configured to be activated in this manner.  Leaving this configuration for extended periods of time in an unmanaged state could be considered a security risk.

#### Important concepts
There are two important concepts to the mass deployment of Retail Modern POS.  Device permission and user permission.
1. Each Retail Modern POS device now has a permission to **Allow mass activation**.  This permission allows the device to be activated one, and only one, time without Azure Active Directory credentials (AAD credentials are required for device activation normally).  While not recommended, if the device requires reactivation and the mass deployment flow is still needed, it is required to reset the **Activation status** of the device to the **Pending** state.  Then set the **Allow mass activation** permission to yes.
2. Each user has a new POS permissions.  This permission, **Allow mass activation**, has been created to allow a user to activate a device that has been configured to activate through mass deployment.  This permission can be set directly on the user's POS permissions or at the group level.  To update a group's permissions, use the menu in the upper left to go to **Retail** &gt; **Employees** &gt; **Permission groups**.  In this page, select the appropriate permission group (E.g. Manager) and set the permission **Allow mass activation** to yes.  This will allow all users set to this permission group to activate a mass deployed Retail Modern POS device.

### Configure mass deployment

#### Configure user permission
1. Use your Azure AD credentials to sign in to Retail headquarters.
2. On the **Welcome** page, use the menu in the upper left to go to **Retail** &gt; **Employees** &gt; **Permission groups**.
3. On the lefthand side, select the appropriate group that requires the new permission (E.g. Manager).
4. In the **Permissions** group, change the setting for **Allow mass activation** to **Yes**.
5. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.
6. On the drop-down menu, select **Configuration file**.
7. Use the menu in the upper left to go to **Retail** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedule**.
8. On the lefthand side, select the **1060** job.
9. On the Action Pane, select **Run now**.
10. On the verification message that appears stating **Do you want to run job 1060**, select **Yes**.

#### Configure device permission
1. Use your Azure AD credentials to sign in to Retail headquarters.
2. On the **Welcome** page, use the menu in the upper left to go to **Workspaces** &gt; **Channel deployment**.  This workspace can also be accessed directly on the homepage for users with permission.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Mass deployment**.
4. On the drop-down menu, select **Mass device update**.
5. On the slide-out that appears from the right-hand side of the window, select the organization nodes that require permission (E.g. In demo data, Houston is a well configured store with many devices to test with) and use the arrow in the center of the slide-out panel that is facing to the right to take your selection from the lefthand **Available organization nodes** and move it to the righthand **Selected organization nodes**.  Repeat this process until all required nodes are shown on the righthand node list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To verify that permission has appropriately been set, use the menu in the upper left to go to **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **Devices**.  On this page, select any device that exists in the nodes configured above and verify that the permission **Allow mass activation** is currently set to **Yes**. As an alternative to the workflow explained in this sub-heading, each device can be manually set to **Yes** for this permission on the **Devices** page.

6. Select **OK** at the bottom of the slide-out to complete device permission configuration.

#### Download the configured devices
1. Use your Azure AD credentials to sign in to Retail headquarters.
2. On the **Welcome** page, use the menu in the upper left to go to **Workspaces** &gt; **Channel deployment**.  This workspace can also be accessed directly on the homepage for users with permission.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Mass deployment**.
4. On the drop-down menu, select **Mass download**.
5. On the slide-out that appears from the right-hand side of the window, select the organization nodes that require permission (E.g. In demo data, Houston is a well configured store with many devices to test with) and use the arrow in the center of the slide-out panel that is facing to the right to take your selection from the lefthand **Available organization nodes** and move it to the righthand **Selected organization nodes**.  Repeat this process until all required nodes are shown on the righthand node list.
6. Select **OK** at the bottom of the slide-out to complete and download the zipped configurations.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The system will generate and collect all of the configuration files and unique Retail Modern POS packages associated with the selected nodes and create a zipped folder to download. If the nodes listed contain a large amount of devices, the generation and collection can take some time to complete and show the download. 
    > Further, a new file titled **RetailAssociationMap.xml** will be generated. This new file allows for easy consumption of configurations.  A configuration includes the name of the configuration file, the name of the installer, the name of the device (Also known as terminal), and the name of the register.  This file will be discussed in more detail further in this article.
    
7. On the Notification bar that appears at the bottom of the Internet Explorer window, select **Save**. (The Notification bar might appear in a different place in other browsers.)

     Browsers might block the download pop-up that is generated. Select either **Allow once** or **Options for this site** &gt; **Always allow**. Then select **Download** again.

#### How to proceed
The zipped folder generated and downloaded include files that are a part of three buckets:
1. The list of XML configuration files, including one file for each device that was selected to be downloaded.
2. The list of one or more Retail Modern POS installation executables.  There will be one file for each unique instance of Retail Modern POS across all the devices that were selected to be downloaded.

    > [!NOTE]
    > As an example of this, assume there are ten devices downloaded.  One of these devices has been configured (Per the Devices page in headquarters) to utilize the customized version of Retail Modern POS titled **MPOS_V1.1.7.exe**.  The other nine devices have been configured to utilize the previous customized version of Retail Modern POS titled **MPOS_V1.1.6.exe**.  Despite there being ten devices, there are only two unique versions of the installer.  When downloading these ten devices, only two executable installers are downloaded (One for each of these two unique instances).

3. The **RetailAssociationMap.xml** lists configurations.  A configuration is the association between a specific unique installer (See the previous line above) and it's associated configuration file, register, and device (Also known as terminal).  This XML file is generated to assist the users in pushing out the appropriate files to the appropriate systems and running the installer correctly.

There are many ways to push data across an organization (to individual computers) and will not be discussed in this article.  The entire folder could be pushed to each machine, the XML could be parsed to push only the required files to each machine, or the files could even be accessed remotely and never pushed to each machine. However the files are utilized, the result is the same to finally run either a scheduled task or a PowerShell script to perform the silent installation of Retail Modern POS.

### Examples of commands for silent mass deployment
This section shows examples regarding self-service mass deployment for Retail Modern POS. This includes Retail Modern POS with offline  and the installer without offline support.  Example PowerShell scripts will also be shown to assist users in performing the installations.

#### Example PowerShell scripts
The following basic script will list the configurations in the **RetailAssociationMap.xml** file:
```
$path = ".\RetailAssociationMap.xml"
$Xpath = "/Configurations/Configuration"
select-xml -path $Path -xPath $xpath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Node
```

The following basic script will select a specific configuration (by filtering based upon a specific value) in the **RetailAssociationMap.xml** file.  Using this as a basis for a larger script would assist in pulling the specific XML configuration file and executable installer necessary to a particular computer:
```
$path = ".\RetailAssociationMap.xml"
$Xpath = "/Configurations/Configuration[@Device='HOUSTON-3']"
select-xml -path $Path -xPath $xpath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Node
```

The last command can even be put into a variable to more easily access the values directly.  This concept will be utilized later.

#### Silently install Retail Modern POS
The following command silently updates the current installation of Modern POS. It has the standard command structure that is used for silent servicing of currently installed components. The structure uses the basic values of **InstallerName.exe** and the command for silent installation, **-S**. This command uses the configuration file that is located in the same file location as the installer, if a configuration file exists there.  This command should not be used if multiple configuration files are available to select.

```
ModernPOSSetup_V73.exe -S
```

> [!NOTE]
> A configuration file is not required for Retail Modern POS. However, the installed Retail Modern POS application will not appropriately activate without the associated configuration file to read from.  

#### Silently install Retail Modern POS with a specific configuration file
The following command silently installs the current installation of Retail Modern POS by using a specific configuration file. This configuration file might not be in the same location as the executable file for the installer or multiple configuration files may be available.

```
ModernPOSSetup_V72.exe -S -C "C:\Temp\ModernPOSSetup_V73_Houston-3.xml"
```

#### Bringing it all together
When all of the above is used as starting points together, a basic script can be achieved to read through the **RetailAssociationMap.xml** file and select the correct device, then perform the installation.  This installation assumes that the configuration file and the installer are both in the same directory as the directory in which the PowerShell script is run from.

```
$path = ".\RetailAssociationMap.xml"
$Xpath = "/Configurations/Configuration[@Device='HOUSTON-3']"
$configuration = select-xml -path $Path -xPath $xpath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Node
$installer = '.\' + $configuration.Installer

& $installer -S -C $configuration.File

```
