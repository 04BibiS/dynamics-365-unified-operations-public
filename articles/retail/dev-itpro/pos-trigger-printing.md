# Retail Modern POS triggers and printing

You can use triggers to capture events that occur before or after Retail Modern POS operations. Using triggers supports several business logic scenarios, including: 
- You can insert custom logic before the operation runs or after it has completed. We have operation-specific triggers and generic triggers called the PreOperationTrigger and PostOperationTrigger. These triggers run at the beginning and end of all POS operations.  
- You can continue or cancel an operation. For example, if your validation fails or returns an error, then you can cancel the operation in pre-trigger. Post-triggers are not cancelable. 
- You can use the post-trigger for scenarios where you want to show custom messages or insert custom fields after the standard logic is performed. 

This topic applies to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition and Dynamics 365 for Retail with Platform update 8 and Retail Application update 4 hotfix. 

The following table shows the list of available triggers and whether they can be cancelled.

## How to implement a trigger

In this example, a custom receipt is printed whenever the user suspends a transaction. This example implements the **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** trigger and prints the custom receipt using the existing print peripheral API.

1.  Open Visual Studio 2015 in administrator mode.
2.  Open the **ModernPOS** solution from **…\RetailSDK\POS**.
3.  Under the **POS.Extensions** project create a new folder named **SuspendReceiptSample**.
4.  Under **SuspendReceiptSample**, create new folder named **TriggersHandlers**.
5.  In the **TriggersHandlers** folder, add a new Typescript file named **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger.ts**.
6.  Add the following **import** statements to import the relevant entities and context.
    ```typescript
    import * as Triggers from "PosApi/Extend/Triggers/TransactionTriggers";
    import { ObjectExtensions } from "PosApi/TypeExtensions";
    import { ClientEntities, ProxyEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";
    import { PrinterPrintRequest, PrinterPrintResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Peripherals";
    import { GetHardwareProfileClientRequest, GetHardwareProfileClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Device";
    import { GetReceiptsClientRequest, GetReceiptsClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/SalesOrders";
    ```
7. Create a new class named **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** and extend it from **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger**.
    ```typescript
    export default class PostSuspendTransactionTrigger extends Triggers.PostSuspendTransactionTrigger { }
    ```
8. Implement the trigger's **execute** method to get the receipt profile and print the custom receipt:
    ```typescript
    public execute(options: Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions): Promise < void> {
        this.context.logger.logVerbose("Executing PostSuspendTransactionTrigger with options " + JSON.stringify(options) + ".");
        if(ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options) || ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options.cart)) {
            // This will never happen, but is included to demonstrate how to return a rejected promise when validation fails.
            let error: ClientEntities.ExtensionError
                = new ClientEntities.ExtensionError("The options provided to the PostSuspendTransactionTrigger were invalid.");
            return Promise.reject(error);
        } else {
            return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new GetHardwareProfileClientRequest())
                .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetHardwareProfileClientResponse>)
                    : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>> => {
                    let hardwareProfile: ProxyEntities.HardwareProfile = response.data.result;
                    // Gets the receipts.
                    let salesOrderId: string = options.cart.Id;
                    let receiptRetrievalCriteria: ProxyEntities.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria = {
                        IsCopy: false,
                        IsRemoteTransaction: false,
                        IsPreview: false,
                        QueryBySalesId: true,
                        ReceiptTypeValue: ProxyEntities.ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7,
                        HardwareProfileId: hardwareProfile.ProfileId
                    };
                    let getReceiptsClientRequest: GetReceiptsClientRequest<GetReceiptsClientResponse> =
                        new GetReceiptsClientRequest(salesOrderId, receiptRetrievalCriteria);
                    return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(getReceiptsClientRequest);
                })
                .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>)
                    : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<PrinterPrintResponse>> => {
                    let receipts: ProxyEntities.Receipt[] = response.data.result;
                    // Prints the receipts.
                    let printerPrintRequest: PrinterPrintRequest<PrinterPrintResponse> = new PrinterPrintRequest(receipts);
                    return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(printerPrintRequest);
                }).then((): Promise<void> => {
                    // Resolves to a void result when fulfilled.
                    return Promise.resolve();
                }).catch((reason: any): Promise<void> => {
                    // Resolves to a void result when rejected. This matches existing POS printing behavior.
                    this.context.logger.logError("PostSuspendTransactionTrigger execute error: " + JSON.stringify(reason));
                    return Promise.resolve();
                });
        }
    }
    ```
 The overall code should look like this:
    ```typescript
    import * as Triggers from "PosApi/Extend/Triggers/TransactionTriggers";
    import { ObjectExtensions } from "PosApi/TypeExtensions";
    import { ClientEntities, ProxyEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";
    import { PrinterPrintRequest, PrinterPrintResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Peripherals";
    import { GetHardwareProfileClientRequest, GetHardwareProfileClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Device";
    import { GetReceiptsClientRequest, GetReceiptsClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/SalesOrders";
    export default class PostSuspendTransactionTrigger extends Triggers.PostSuspendTransactionTrigger {
        /**
        * Executes the trigger functionality.
        * @param {Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions} options The options provided to the trigger.
        */
        public execute(options: Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions): Promise<void> {
            this.context.logger.logVerbose("Executing PostSuspendTransactionTrigger with options " + JSON.stringify(options) + ".");
            if (ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options) || ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options.cart)) {
                // This will never happen, but is included to demonstrate how to return a rejected promise when validation fails.
                let error: ClientEntities.ExtensionError
                    = new ClientEntities.ExtensionError("The options provided to the PostSuspendTransactionTrigger were invalid.");
                return Promise.reject(error);
            } else {
                return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new GetHardwareProfileClientRequest())
                    .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetHardwareProfileClientResponse>)
                        : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>> => {
                        let hardwareProfile: ProxyEntities.HardwareProfile = response.data.result;
                        // Gets the receipts.
                        let salesOrderId: string = options.cart.Id;
                        let receiptRetrievalCriteria: ProxyEntities.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria = {
                            IsCopy: false,
                            IsRemoteTransaction: false,
                            IsPreview: false,
                            QueryBySalesId: true,
                            ReceiptTypeValue: ProxyEntities.ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7,
                            HardwareProfileId: hardwareProfile.ProfileId
                        };
                        let getReceiptsClientRequest: GetReceiptsClientRequest<GetReceiptsClientResponse> =
                            new GetReceiptsClientRequest(salesOrderId, receiptRetrievalCriteria);
                        return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(getReceiptsClientRequest);
                    })
                    .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>)
                        : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<PrinterPrintResponse>> => {
                        let receipts: ProxyEntities.Receipt[] = response.data.result;
                        // Prints the receipts.
                        let printerPrintRequest: PrinterPrintRequest<PrinterPrintResponse> = new PrinterPrintRequest(receipts);
                        return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(printerPrintRequest);
                    }).then((): Promise<void> => {
                        // Resolves to a void result when fulfilled.
                        return Promise.resolve();

9. Create a new json file and under the POSAPIExtension folder and name it as manifest.json.

10. In the manifest.json file, copy and paste the below code:
```typescript
 {

 "$schema": "../manifestSchema.json",

 "name": "Pos_Extensibility_SuspendTransactionReceiptSample",

 "publisher": "Microsoft",

 "version": "7.2.0",

 "minimumPosVersion": "7.2.0.0",

 "components": {

 "extend": {

 "triggers": [

 {

 "triggerType": "PostSuspendTransaction",

 "modulePath": "TriggersHandlers/PostSuspendTransactionTrigger"

 }

 ]

 }

 }

}
```
11. Open the extensions.json file under POS.Extensions project and update it with SuspendReceiptSample samples, so that POS during runtime will include this extension.
```typescript
 {

 "extensionPackages": [

 {

 "baseUrl": "SampleExtensions2"

 },
 {

 "baseUrl": "SuspendReceiptSample"

 }

 ]

}
```
12. Open the tsconfig.json to comment out the extension package folders from the exclude list. POS will use this file to include or exclude the extension. By default, the list contains all the excluded extensions list, if you want to include any extension part of the POS then you need add the extension folder name and comment the extension from the extension list like below.
```typescript
 "exclude": [

 "AuditEventExtensionSample",

 "B2BSample",

 "CustomerSearchWithAttributesSample",

 "FiscalRegisterSample",

 "PaymentSample",

 "PromotionsSample",

 "SalesTransactionSignatureSample",

 "SampleExtensions",

 //"SampleExtensions2",

 "StoreHoursSample",

 "SuspendTransactionReceiptSample"

 //"POSAPIExtension",

 //"CustomColumnExtensions",

 //"EODSample",

 //"ProdDetailsCustomColumnExtensions",

 //"SerachExtension",

 //"SuspendReceiptSample"

],
```
