# Implementing Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Retail projects

The purpose of the following topics are to help new implementers of Retail projects with important aspects of the process to avoid complications. The guidelines mentioned are best practices that have been collected during previous implementation projects. These guimplementers can focus on the actual feature work and not get bogged down by the procedures.

Some of this information is captured in blogs and wiki pages at other locations such as https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/index, https://dynamicsnotes.com/, etc. These blogs can be read separately, or you can read this information from the beginning to the end and review the linked documents at the time of their reference.  

The information focuses on Dynamics 365 F&O implementations with Retail aspects.
