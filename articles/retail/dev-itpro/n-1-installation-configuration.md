Install N-1 Components
Before you run the Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX installers, make sure that the following requirements are met:
•	The installer requires that the Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.1 be installed on the system.
•	The installers install the Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX applications only on the following operating systems. Before you install any component, you must update the operating system with all service packs and updates that are available for it.
•	Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate edition (both x86 and x64 architectures). Home edition and embedded edition aren’t supported.
•	Windows 8.1 Update 1 Pro or Enterprise edition (both x86 and x64 architectures). Standard edition isn’t supported.
•	Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise edition (both x86 and x64 architectures). Home edition isn’t supported.
•	Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016.
 
Async Server Connector Service
The installer validates that all prerequisites are met. These prerequisites include SQL prerequisites, such as a local installation of SQL Server, or the alternative prerequisites, such as SQL Command Line Utilities and other required SQL connectivity installations.
To meet prerequisites, the SQL Server that is connected to must have Full-text search and, at a minimum, support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. For Microsoft SQL Server 2012, Service Pack 3 must be installed, at a minimum. For Microsoft SQL Server 2014, Service Pack 2 must be installed.
If a system restart is required, the installer shows this requirement. Although the restart is recommended, the installer can continue without it.
Once ready follow these steps to download and install the component:
1.	Sing in to the Dynamics 365 for Retail headquarters and navigate to the Retail > Headquarters setup > Retail scheduler > Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX form and select the connector you created in the steps above.
2.	Click on DOWNLOAD in the action pane and select the Async Server Connector Services and corresponding Configuration file. Make sure that the configuration file is always dropped next to the setup file.
3.	Once downloaded, double click on the installer and follow these steps:
A.	Verify the Application Object Server (AOS) URL (the URL that is used to access Retail headquarters), and then select Next.

B.	If a specific user is required, enter the user name and password that the service should run as. By default, the installer automatically generates a service account to use. This approach is more secure and is recommended, but it can't be used when the database is located on a separate computer . Select Next to continue.
C.	Enter the application ID (client ID) and secret that are associated with this Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX installation. 
D.	Click Install.
Note, for information about how to correctly generate an Azure Web App to create a client ID and secret, see the "Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD" section in Create an Azure Active Directory Application.
When you create the Web App, the initial URI and URL don't have to be any specific value. Only the application ID (client ID) and secret that are created are important.
4.	After an application ID (client ID) and secret are created, the application ID must be accepted in Retail. Navigate to Retail > Headquarters setup > Azure Active Directory applications. Enter the client ID in the Client ID column, enter descriptive text in the Name column, and enter RetailServiceAccount in the User ID column.
5.	Sing in to the Dynamics 365 for Retail headquarters and navigate to the Retail > Headquarters setup > Parameters > Retail shared parameters form, select Identity providers on the left pane, and select the provider that begins with HTTPS://sts.windows.net/. The values on the Relying parties FastTab are set, based on your selection.
6.	On the Relying parties FastTab, select +Add. Enter the client ID that was created for this installation. Set the Type field to Public and the UserType field to Worker. Then, on the Action Pane, select Save.
7.	On the Action Pane, select Save. 
N-1 Realtime Service   
1.	Sing in to the Dynamics 365 for Retail headquarters and navigate to the Retail > Headquarters setup > Retail scheduler > Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX form and select the connector you created in the steps above.
2.	Click on DOWNLOAD in the action pane and select the Real-time service for Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and corresponding Configuration file. Make sure that the configuration file is always dropped next to the setup file.
3.	Once downloaded, double click on the installer and follow these steps:
A.	Verify the Application Object Server (AOS) URL (the URL that is used to access Retail headquarters), and then select Next.

B.	Select a valid SSL certificate to use for HTTPS communication. Select Next to continue.
i.	The certificate must use private key storage, and server authentication must be listed in the enhanced key usage property. Additionally, the certificate must be trusted locally, and it can’t be expired. It must be stored in the personal certificate store location on the local computer.

C.	If a specific user is required, enter the user name and password that the application pool should run as. By default, the installer automatically generates a service account to use. This approach is more secure and is recommended, but it can't be used when the database is located on a separate computer. Select Next to continue.
D.	Verify the HTTPS port that should be used and verify that the host name of the computer is correct. Select Next to continue.

i.	The HTTPS port is listed in the Store system profile. To access the Store system profile, on the Retail store details page, on the Store systems FastTab, select the profile ID of the selected Store system.

The installer automatically enters the host name. If, for any reason, the host name must be changed for the installation, change it here. The host name must be the FQDN of the system, and it must match the value that you entered on the Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX page earlier in this topic.
E.	Enter the application ID (client ID) and secret that are associated with this Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX installation. Then select Install.
i.	This application ID and secret can be the same application ID and secret that you used in the Async Server Connector service installation. For information about how to correctly generate an Azure Web App to create a client ID and secret, see the "Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD" section in Create an Azure Active Directory Application.

When you create the Web App, the initial URI and URL don't have to be any specific value. Only the application ID (client ID) and secret that are created are important.

To fix the issue run services.msc, check the user who runs the Async server connector service. Provide this user access to HQ message database in SQL. 

Metadata synchronization fails or CDX Jobs were successfully downloaded but failed to apply
Event Log	Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail : Async Client SynchClientService 

Sample Event Log Error Message	Unable to communicate with server for download. Please check username/password, server and database connections. Error Details: System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException: An error occurred while making the HTTP request to https://localhost:44300/SynchService/DownloadService.svc. This could be due to the fact that the server certificate is not configured properly with HTTP.SYS in the HTTPS case. This could also be caused by a mismatch of the security binding between the client and the server. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send. ---> System.IO.IOException: Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream. 
MPOS Error on Activation Screen	-
Troubleshooting Steps	This could have happened because of the following reasons.
1)    The user ID and password that we provide in async client does not match with the channel database User ID and password that we provide in AX.
2)    The async service end point is not reachable. 
https://localhost:44300/SynchService/DownloadService.svc
 
To fix this issue, 
1)    Launch the Async client configuration utility (AsyncClientConfigurationUtility.exe) from the async client install location. Under the “Async Server connection” tab -> Authentication information (case sensitive) -> Update the Channel database ID, User name and Password fields as per the values provided under N-1 channel database (retail -> Headquarters setup -> Channel database) in AX. 
2)    Now click on “Test connection” in the utility. If the connection is successful, restart the Async client service. If the connection fails, go to N-1 channel database (retail -> Headquarters setup -> Channel database) in AX, update the Username and password, save. Go to Retail scheduler parameters in AX and click “Reset metadata synchronization.” This will populate the HQ message database with the new values. Repeat step 1 again.  
3)    If the async server end point (https://localhost:44300/SynchService/DownloadService.svc)
is not reachable, check the bindings of the service and make sure there is a certificate associated.  
If the issue still exists, check that the “Working folders” were specified for all the Channel database group’s that were linked to “AX2012R3” retail channel schema.
