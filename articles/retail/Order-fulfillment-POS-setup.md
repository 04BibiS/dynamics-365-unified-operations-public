# Order fulfillment point of sale setup

## Overview
Many retailers would like to optimize order fulfillment byaenabling stores to fill orders. Order fulfillment at the store level can help
to ease overstock scenarios for a specific store, or may be desirable from a logistical standpoint in cases where a store has extra
capacity or is located within closer shipping distance to the customer. To address this need, a unified order fulfillment operation is
available at the point of sale.

Orders for fulfillment at a specific store will have the store's warehouse designated on the header or lines of the order. 

The order fulfillment operation in the point of sale provides a single work area in the point of sale that can be used to process orders from accepting the order to marking it as shipped or initiating store pickup.
