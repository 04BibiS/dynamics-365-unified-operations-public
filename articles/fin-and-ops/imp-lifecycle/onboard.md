# Onboarding a Finance and Operations project

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to onboard a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition project using Microsoft Lifecycle Services.

Lifecycle Services Implementation project workspace
---------------------------------------------------

After you have purchased and activated your subscription(s) to Microsoft
Dynamics for Finance and Operations, an Implementation project workspace gets
provisioned in Lifecycle Services (LCS) when the tenant administrator logs on to
LCS for the first time. If you are a customer and need help getting started with
LCS, see [Lifecycle Services for Finance and Operations
customers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs).
For a comprehensive overview of Lifecycle Services, see [Overview of Lifecycle
Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs).

FastTrack Onboarding services
-----------------------------

The provisioning of your LCS implementation project workspace is the trigger for
the FastTrack team to reach out to your project team with Onboarding services.
For more information on the FastTrack program and the services it offers, see
[Microsoft FastTrack for Dynamics
365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/fasttrack-dynamics-365-overview).

The FastTrack team will reach out to all partner and customer users in LCS to
schedule a 60-minute Onboarding call via Skype to introduce the FastTrack
program to you and assist you with the initial configuration of the LCS project
and related tasks: 

-   Tenant Validation 

-   Introduction to Lifecycle Services (LCS)

-   Set up LCS Project users 

-   VSTS Setup 

-   Subscription estimator / Usage profile

-   Environment Planning 

-   Environment Deployment

-   Introduction to Servicing, Support and Service Health

-   Readiness planning 

It is recommended that the following roles participate in the meeting; others
are generally optional: 

-   **Customer**

    -   Project owner 

    -   VLSC Admin, if the license was procured through a Volume Service
        agreement with Microsoft 

-   **Partner** 

    -   Delivery lead / Solutions Architect 

    -   Project manager 

 

Please make sure to have the key project members (like project managers) added
to the LCS project with their work email address. This way they will not miss
important communication from us. 

By keeping the Milestone Dates in LCS current, you help us to connect
with you when required in different project stages. When you are closer to your
Go-live, we’ll reach out to you for a project Go-live assessment prior to
deploying your Production environment. Please update the Milestone dates in the
LCS implementation methodology when project timelines change. If you need help
on updating the milestone dates, see [Lifecycle Services for Finance and
Operations
customers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs).

The onboarding call is an optional service; partners who are experienced with
Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations implementations can work through the
tasks with their customers without the help of the FastTrack team. In those
cases, it is especially important to keep the project users and Milestone Dates
current.
