# Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations architecture

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The cloud architecture for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations includes services that automate software deployment and provisioning, operational monitoring and reporting, and seamless application lifecycle management.

![Cloud architecture](./media/cloud-architecture.png)

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations cloud architecture consists of these conceptual areas:

  - **Subscription** – A subscription to Finance and Operations (cloud) gives you an online cloud environment(s) and experience. 
  - **Licenses** – Customers must purchase Subscription Licenses (SLs) for their organization or their affiliates’ employees and on-site agents, vendors, or contractors who directly or indirectly access Finance and Operations. Finance and Operations is licensed through the Microsoft Volume Licensing (VL) and the Cloud Solution Provider Program (CSP) For more information, download the latest [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide from Dynamics 365 pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/).
  - **Tenant** - In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a tenant represents an organization. It is a dedicated instance of the Azure AD service that an organization receives and owns when it creates a relationship with Microsoft, such as by signing up for a Microsoft cloud service like Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. Each Azure AD tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD tenants. For more information about Azure AD tenants, see [How to get an Azure Active Directory Tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).
  A tenant houses the company's user information including passwords, user profile data, permissions, and related information. It also contains groups, applications, and other information that pertains to an organization and its security.
  The tenant is created when a customer signs up for their first subscription of any Microsoft Online Service, such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft Azure, or any other online service. Subsequently, more subscriptions of the same or other Microsoft Online Services can be grouped within the same tenant.
  An organization can have multiple AAD tenants. If there are multiple tenants, ensure that the subscriptions for Finance and Operations are associated with the correct tenant.
  - **Microsoft Azure Active Directory** –  Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s multi-tenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection into a single solution. For more information see [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/). Finance and Operations is using Azure AD as the store for identity. Access to Azure AD comes as part of a subscription to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
  - **Microsoft Office 365 admin center** – Office 365 admin center is the subscription management portal that Office 365 provides for administrators. The Office 365 admin center is used to provide management functions for users (Azure AD) and subscriptions, including information about service health. For more information, see [About the Office 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-the-office-365-admin-center-758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). 
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > You do not need an Office 365 license to deploy Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. However, you might need a license for specific Office integration scenarios. For more information, see [Office integration](../../dev-itpro/office-integration/office-integration.md).
  
  - **Lifecycle Services (LCS)** – Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Microsoft Dynamics is a collaboration portal that provides an environment and a set of regularly updated services that can help you manage the application lifecycle of your Finance and Operations implementations. For more information, see [Lifecycle Services for Finance and Operations](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs.md). After you've purchased and activated a subscription to Finance and Operations, an Implementation project workspace is provisioned in LCS when the tenant administrator signs in for the first time.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > An Implementation project is an LCS project for the Microsoft-managed Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations cloud service. As a Microsoft partner, you can also provision non-implementation LCS projects for your own purposes. For more information, see [Lifecycle Services for Finance and Operations partners](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/getting-started-lcs.md). 
  
  - **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations** – Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is deployed through Lifecycle Services LCS. Various topologies are available: development/test/build, acceptance test, performance test, and high-availability production. For more information about different topologies, download the [latest Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide from Dynamics 365 pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/).
  - **Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)** – Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is primarily used for code version control and deploying a build environment. VSTS is also used to track support incidents, such as work items in VSTS submitted to Microsoft through Cloud Powered Support and integration of the Business Process Modeler (BPM) library hierarchy into your VSTS project as a hierarchy of work items. VSTS is also used during code upgrade.

Under the hood many features of the Azure platform are used, such as Microsoft Azure Storage, networking, monitoring, and SQL Azure, to name a few. Shared services put into operation and orchestrate the application lifecycle of the environments for participants. Together, Azure functionality and Lifecycle Services (LCS) will offer a robust cloud service.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Although many features of Azure platform are used, you don’t need an Azure subscription to deploy Finance and Operations in Microsoft-Managed cloud. You only need an Azure subscription to deploy Finance and Operations cloud-hosted environments into your own Azure subscription.
