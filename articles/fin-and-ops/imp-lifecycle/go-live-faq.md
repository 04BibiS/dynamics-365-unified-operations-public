# Preparing for go live

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes frequently asked questions about going live with a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition project.

**Go-live FAQ**

1.  **When can I configure and request my production environment?**

>   Typically, Production environment is deployed when all customizations are
>   code-complete, the user acceptance test (UAT) is complete, customer has
>   signed off on the solution and there are no Go-live blockers.

>   When you're at this stage, Microsoft FastTrack team will work with the
>   project team to do a Pre-Go-live review or assessment.

1.  **What're the prerequisites to deploy production environment?**

>   Refer the following article on Preparing for Go-live

1.  **What is Pre-Go-live review and why is it required?**

>   Pre-Go-live review is part of [Microsoft FastTrack
>   program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/fasttrack-dynamics-365-overview)
>   where a solutions architect assesses readiness of the project for a
>   successful cutover and Go-live. This review is mandatory for every Dynamics
>   365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition project before requesting
>   the production environment.

1.  **I want to request my production environment but who do I contact for
    Pre-Go-live review?**

    If you have a FastTrack solution architect assigned to your project, please
    reach out to him or her directly. Otherwise, based your Go-live date
    specified in LCS, you will receive an email to fill out the Pre-Go-live
    checklist and send it to <go-live@microsoft.com> few weeks before the
    Go-live date. If you’ve not received an email and you’re ready for Go-live,
    you can download the Pre-Go-live Checklist from here, fill it up and send it
    to <go-live@microsoft.com>

2.  **The Production button is not enabled in LCS. How do I request my
    Production environment?**

>   To enable the Production button in LCS, it is mandatory to complete the
>   A*nalysis*, *Design & develop*, and *Test* phases of the LCS implementation
>   methodology. Read more about completing Methodology tasks and phases
>   [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs)

>   **Note**: Production environment will not be deployed unless the Pre-Go-live
>   review is complete.

1.  **My sandbox environment is currently on a platform update which is set to
    expire in 2 months. Can I request Production with the latest platform
    update?**

>   No. Such requests will be denied. When configuring production environment,
>   it is required that you select the same Application and Platform version as
>   that of your sandbox environment in which your solution is signed-off. If
>   you want the production environment with the latest platform update, you
>   will have to apply the latest platform update to your sandbox environments
>   first, test it and sign off.

>   **Link**: [Versions Update
>   Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/versions-update-policy)

1.  **My Sandbox environments are deployed in Central US datacenter, but we
    would like to have our Production deployed in West US datacenter. Can I
    select West US as my data center in my Production configuration?**

>   No. Such requests will be denied. It is required that all your environments
>   reside in the same data center. If you wish to have your Production in West
>   US data center, you will have to move your Sandbox environments to West US
>   data center, test and sign-off your solution first.

>   Refer **Network requirements** section in System requirements document to
>   help you choose the right data center.

1.  **How will my production environment be sized?**

>   Your production environment will be sized based on the current user license
>   count and the information in subscription estimate that is active when you
>   request the production environment. ** **

>   **Note**: If you add additional users in future, you must create a support
>   ticket to activate a new subscription estimate. Whether resizing is
>   necessary depends on the number of users, the type of user licenses and the
>   expected peak transaction volume. Resizing of the production environment
>   requires downtime.

1.  **I submitted the request for Production environment, but I made a mistake;
    can I still change it?**

>   Yes, as long as the Production environment is in *Queued* state you can
>   clear the sign off, make changes, and then sign off again.

1.  **How long does it take to deploy my production environment?**

>   Once the Pre-Go-live review with the Microsoft FastTrack team is complete
>   and the production request is submitted, the deployment of production should
>   complete within 2 business days.

1.  **What level of access do I have in my D365FFO Production environment? Can I
    login to the VM?**

>   No. Access to Production environment is limited. You cannot access the VM,
>   IIS or manipulate the database through SQL Management Studio.

1.  **How often is my production database backed up?**

>   Databases are protected by automatic back-ups per [Azure
>   capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups).
>   Full database backups are taken weekly, differential database backups are
>   taken hourly, and transaction log backups are taken every 5 minutes.
>   Automatic back-ups are retained for 35 days.

1.  **Can I request a copy of the backup of my production database?**

>   No. However, you can raise a database refresh service request to copy your
>   production database to your tier-2 and above Sandbox environment. You can
>   take a backup of your Sandbox environment once the copy request is complete.

1.  My gold configuration database is in a tier 1 sandbox, what should I do to
    copy and restore it to production environment?"**?**

>   First, you will have to move your gold configuration database from tier 1 to
>   tier 2. Next, You can raise a service request to copy your golden
>   configuration from Tier 2 and above sandbox environment (like Sandbox:
>   Standard Acceptance Test) to Production environment.

>   **See**: Copy a Finance and Operations database from SQL Server to a
>   production Azure SQL Database environment

>   **Note**: In case your Golden configuration is in Data Packages, you will
>   have to import them in Production environment manually.

1.  **After going live, can I apply new code changes to the production
    environment?**

>   Yes. You can raise a service request in LCS to apply a deployable package to
>   your production environment. Applying 1 deployable package to production
>   involves a lead time of 5 hours and downtime of approximately 5 hours.

>   **Link**: [Apply deployable package
>   ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/apply-deployable-package-system)

1.  **What should I do if my production environment is down?**

>   Please follow the process in the following link to report production outage

>   *New process to report a production outage through Lifecycle Services*
