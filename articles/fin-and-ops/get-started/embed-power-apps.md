# Embed PowerApps

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


[!Note] This feature is supported in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition platform update 14 or later.

## Overview
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition supports integration with Microsoft PowerApps, a service for developers and nontechnical users to build custom business apps for mobile devices, tablets, and the web without writing code. PowerApps developed by you, your organization, or the broader ecosystem can then be embedded in the Finance and Operations client to augment the product's functionality. For example, you might build a PowerApp to supplement Finance and Operations with information retrieved from another system, or you might want to surface mobile or tablet experiences built using PowerApps inside the Finance and Operations client.  

## Building a PowerApp that leverages data from Finance and Operations
An important part of building a PowerApp to be used within or in conjunction with Finance and Operations is designing the PowerApp to accept data from an outside source, in particular from Finance and Operations.  


## Adding an embedded PowerApp to a page
Before embedding a PowerApp into the Finance and Operations client, you first need to find or build a PowerApp with the desired visuals and/or functionality. We will not describe the detailed process for building a PowerApp here; however, the Introduction to PowerApps article is a good starting point for those who are new to PowerApps.

Once you are ready to embed a particular PowerApp, you can choose between one of two ways of accessing the PowerApp on a page. The first way is through the new PowerApps button that has been added to the standard Action Pane. PowerApps added via this mechanism will appear as menu items inside the PowerApps menu button. When accessed, each of these menu items will open a dialog containing the embedded PowerApp. Alternatively, you may choose to show a PowerApp directly on a page inside a pivot tab, fast tab, vertical tab, or panorama section. 

When you have a PowerApp ready to be included in Finance and Operations, you can follow these instructions to include the PowerApp into the Finance and Operations web client.  

1. Navigate to the page where you would like to embed the PowerApp. This will be the same page that contains any data that needs to be passed to the PowerApp as input.  
2. Determine where on the page the PowerApp should appear.  Finance and Operations supports adding PowerApps to pages in two ways: 


## Editing an embedded PowerApp
After a PowerApp has been embedded onto a page in the system, you may need to make some changes to the configuration of that PowerApp. For example, perhaps you want to modify the label associated with the embedded PowerApp or you or your organization have created a new version of a PowerApp, and you need to update the App ID to point at the latest PowerApp. 

Follow these steps to edit the configuration of an embedded PowerApp:
1. Navigate to the **Edit a PowerApp** dialog. 
   - If the embedded PowerApp is accessed through the PowerApps menu button, right-click on the PowerApps menu button and select Personalize. Select the PowerApp you are you interested in from the **Select PowerApp** dropdown.  
   - If the embedded PowerApp appears directly on the page, select **Options** and then **Personalize this form**. Using the **Select** tool, click on the embedded PowerApp.  
2. Make the needed modifications to the PowerApps configuration, and then click Save.  

## Removing an embedded PowerApp
Once a PowerApp has been embedded onto a page in the system, there are two ways to remove it if desired: 
1. Navigate to the **Edit a PowerApp** dialog using the instructions from the [Editing an embedded PowerApp]. After confirming the dialog is showing information for the embedded PowerApp you would like to remove, simply click the **Delete** button. 
2. Since an embedded PowerApp is saved as personalization data, clearing your page's personalization will also remove any embedded PowerApps on that form. Note that clearing the page's personalization is permanent and cannot be undone. To remove your personalizations on a page, select **Options** and then click **Personalize this form**. Under the **Manage** menu, select the **Clear** button. After refreshing your browser, all the previous personalizations for this page will be removed. See Personalization the user experience for more information about how to optimize pages in Finance and Operations using personalization.  

## Sharing an embedded PowerApp
After you have embedded a PowerApp on a page and confirmed it is working correctly with any data context passed from the form, you may want to share this embedded PowerApp with other users in the system. This can be accomplished in two different ways using the personalization capabilities of the product:

- The recommended route is through the system administrator, who has the ability to push a personalization to all users or a subset of users. 

- Alternatively, you can export your changes (called personalizations), send them to one or more users, and have each of those users import your changes. The Manage option on the personalization toolbar enables you to export and import personalizations.

See Personalize the user experience for more details on how to use .
