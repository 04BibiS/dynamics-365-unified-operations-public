# Alerts overview

## About alerts
Alerts form a notification system for critical events in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. You can use alerts to stay informed about events that you want to keep track of during the workday. You can easily set up your own set of rules so that you are alerted about overdue deliveries, orders that are deleted, prices that change, or other events that you must respond to.

Here are a few common scenarios in enterprise resource planning that will utilize the alerts feature available in Finance and Operations.

### Scenario 1:  Create an alert rule for new sales orders
   1. Navigate to the **All sales orders** page.
   2. Click the **Options** menu.
   3. Under the **Share** tab, click on **Alert me**, and select **Create alert rule**.
   4. Expand the **Alert me when** section. In the **Event list**, select **Record has been created**. 

### Scenario 2:  Create an alert rule for postponement of a delivery date
   1. Navigate to the **All purchase orders** page.
   2. Click on a purchase order ID to access the purchase order details.
   3. Expand the **Purchase order header** tab. 
   4. Expand the **Options** menu
   5. Under the **Share** tab, click on **Alert me**, and select **Create alert rule**
   6. Expand the **Alert me when** section, open the **Field** list, and select **Delivery date**
   7. In the **Event** list, select **has been postponed**. 
	
When you close the **Create alert rule** form, your rule appears in the **Manage alert rules** form.  Use the Manage alert rules form to update your existing Alert rules.  This include modifying event triggers, updating event notifications, and expiration dates.  Access the **Manage alert rules** form using the **Alert me** drop-down in the **Options** menu.

### What occurs when an alert rule is created?
When you create alert rules, you can associate a predefined event with a field. For example, when the date that is specified in the field occurs, or when the contents of a field change. Alternatively, you can associate an event with the records in a particular form. For example, when the record is created or deleted. 

When the selected event occurs for that field, or a record in that form, an alert is sent to you. For example, you create a rule in which you associate the Delivery date field on a specific purchase order line with the was due this amount of time ago event. You set the time frame to five days. In this example, an alert is triggered five days after the delivery date of that purchase order line. 

Additionally, you can refine the alert rules by setting conditions. For example, you can be alerted about new purchase orders that are created for specific vendor accounts. 

### Preparing for an alert
Before you set up an alert rule, decide when or in what situations you want to receive alerts. When you know which event you want to be notified about, locate the application form where the data that causes the event is displayed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations. The event can be a date that arrives or a change that occurs. Therefore, you must find the application form where this date is specified, or where the field that changes or the new record is displayed. When you have this information, you can proceed with creating your alert rule.

### Components of an alert rule
**There are five components to an alert rule**
   1. **Event** - The event that triggers an alert rule can be a date that arrives or a specific change that occurs. Events are defined in the Send email alerts for job status changes area of the Create alert rule form.
   2. **Condition** - In the Alert me for area of the Create alert rule form, you can use choose the scope of the condition to control when you are alerted about events.  Choose to apply to rule to only the current record or all visible records in the form.  You can also set the rule to be Organization-wide if the rule applies across legal entities.
   3. **Expiry of rule** - In the Alert me until area of the Create alert rule form, you can specify how long you want the alert rule to be active
   4. **Contents** - In the Alert me with area of the Create alert rule form, you can specify the subject text and message text that you want the alert messages to use. 
   5. **User** - In the Alert who area of the Create alert rule form, you can specify which user you want to receive the alert messages. By default, your user ID is selected.  
   **Note:**  this option is restricted to Organization administrators.
