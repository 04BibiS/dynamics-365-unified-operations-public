### Platform update 21 bug fixes

## TransientSqlConnectionError X++ exception
During an X++ SQL query execution, when a transient SQL connection error occurs on the server side, a TransientSqlConnectionError X++ exception will occur. Depending on the application requirements, the application should catch and handle the exception.

This exception usually occurs during a large transaction or when the database is under a lot of processing pressure.

The TransientSqlConnectionError exception is not catchable within the transaction. The X++ transaction that encounters this exception is canceled (calling **ttsAbort**) before the exception occurs. This means that you need to use the catch block to identify the transient SQL connection error instead of a generic X++ error exception, and then retry the outermost transaction or retry application code logic in a new session. This exception allows the application to be designed for transient server failures.

If an application transaction takes a long time to process, you can use multiple incremental delays to catch the TransientSqlConnectionError exception. Retrying your application code in a new session is most likely to succeed after you have caught the exception.


### Example
```
public static void LargeTransactionWrapper()
{
    try
    {
        LargeTransaction();
    }
    catch (Exception::TransientSqlConnectionError)
    {
        info("Caught transient SQL connection error, ttslevel=" + int2Str(appl.ttsLevel()));
        // At this point, transaction is canceled
        // Code that indicates retry is possible
    }
    finally
    {
        // Do clean up
    }
}
```
