# Managing alerts
[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Alerts are processed by the batch processing functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. Batch processing must be set up before alerts can be delivered. 

## Finance and Operations supports two types of events: 
   - Events that are triggered by change-based events. These events are also referred to as create/delete and update events. 
   - Events that are triggered by due dates. 

You can set up batch processes for each type of event.

## Set up alert batch execution 
You can set up batch processing for both due-date events and change-based events. The setup for each kind of event is completed in a different page. 

## Set up processing for due-date alerts
   1. Navigate to **System administration > Periodic > Alerts > Due date alerts**. 
   2. In the **Due date alerts** pane, enter the appropriate information. 
	
## Set up processing for change-based alerts
   1. Navigate to **System administration > Periodic > Alerts > Change based alerts**. 
   2. In the **Change based alerts** pane, enter the appropriate information. 
	
## Process batches for change-based events
Finance and Operations reads all change-based events that have occurred since batch processing was last run. Change-based events include updates to fields, the deletion of records, and the creation of records. These events are compared with the conditions that are set up in alert rules. When an event matches the conditions in a rule, the batch process generates an alert. 

## Set up a batch frequency for change-based events
For change-based events, you can set up a batch job that triggers the processing of an event soon after the event is logged by the system. If you set up the batch job to recur more frequently, users receive their alerts sooner after a change occurs. However, a high frequency for batch processing might adversely affect the performance of the system. 

On the other hand, a batch job that recurs less frequently, and that is scheduled for times when the system load is low, might help improve system performance. However, a low frequency for batch processing might not fulfill users' demands for timely alerts. 

Therefore, when you set up the frequency of batch processing for change-based events, consider the balance between the timeliness of alerts and the performance of the whole system. 

These considerations become more relevant as the number of users who create alert rules increases. The frequency does not affect the number of events that must be processed. However, if more users create rules, more checks must be performed. This kind of data exchange might affect system performance. 

## Examine the risks of low batch frequency
If you set the batch processing for change-based events to a low frequency, you might lose alerts, because data that is relevant to the conditions in alert rules changes before the batch is processed. 

For example, an alert rule is set up to trigger an alert when the event is **customer contact changes** and the condition is **customer = BB**. Therefore, when the customer contact changes for customer BB, the event is logged. However, the batch processing system is set up so that batch processing occurs less frequently than data entry. If the customer name changes from BB to AA before the event is processed, the data in the database no longer matches the condition in the rule, customer = BB. Therefore, when the event is finally processed, no alert is generated. 

## Process batches for due date events
Finance and Operations detects all events that are caused by due dates, and these events are compared with the conditions that are set up in alert rules. The batch process generates an alert when an event matches the conditions in a rule. 

## Set up batch frequency for due date events
For due date events, you might want to set up batch jobs that run during the night or at specific times of the day, to balance the system load. We recommend that you set up the batch job to run at least one time per day. If you want alerts to be sent as early as possible, set up the batch processing to occur immediately after the system date changes. If you want to generate alerts for due date events that occur after a batch job has already processed alerts, you can run the batch job again on the same day. 

For example, a batch job has run on a particular day. You then create a purchase order that has a due date that should trigger an alert on that same day. To receive the alert on that day, you have to run the batch job again after the purchase order is created. However, if you do not run the batch job again on that day, the next day's batch job detects any due date events that were not processed on previous days. 

> [!Note]
> Even when the batch process is run more than one time per day, alerts are not duplicated for the same due date event and conditions. Alerts are generated only for dates that have become due because of changes that occurred in the system after the last batch job was run. 

## Set flexible due dates
Processing of alert rules in a company can be stopped for several reasons. These reasons include vacations, system errors, or other issues that cause batch jobs not to run for some time. 

To prevent due date alerts from becoming obsolete because the batch job has not run for several days, you can set up a batch processing window. A batch processing window enables a batch job not to run for a specified number of days. 

When a batch processing window is set up, an alert is sent when the alert rule is processed, even if the alert exceeds the time limit that is defined in the due date criteria. An alert continues to be sent as long as the period that is defined by this time limit plus the batch processing window is not exceeded.  However, when the period that is defined by the time limit plus the batch processing window is exceeded, an alert is no longer sent.
