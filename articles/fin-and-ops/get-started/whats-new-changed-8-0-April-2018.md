### Introducing Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations

Users and developers will see an updated product name, "Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations." With release 8.0, Microsoft is further simplifying our Dynamics 365 offerings and increasing ease of selection for our customers and ecosystem. Going forward, Microsoft is no longer offering separate editions (Business edition and Enterprise edition), so the product name for this Dynamics 365 application is Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

### Cost management Power BI content
The **Cost management** Microsoft Power BI content is intended for inventory accountants or individuals in the organization who are responsible for or interested in the status of inventory or work in progress (WIP), or who are responsible for or interested in analyzing standard cost variances.

This Power BI content provides a categorized format that helps you monitor the performance of inventories and visualize how cost flows through them. You can gain managerial insights such as the turnover ratio, number of days that inventory is on hand, accuracy, and "ABC classification" at your preferred aggregated level (company, item, item group, or site). The information that is made available can also be used as a detailed supplement to the financial statement.

The **Cost management** Power BI content is shown in the **Cost administration** and **Cost analysis** workspaces. For more information, see [Cost management Power BI content](../../dev-itpro/analytics/cost-management-content-pack.md).
