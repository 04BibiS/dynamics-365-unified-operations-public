### Introducing Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations

With release 8.0, Microsoft is further simplifying our Dynamics 365 offerings and increasing ease of selection for our customers and ecosystem. Going forward, Microsoft is no longer offering separate editions (Business edition and Enterprise edition), so the product name for this Dynamics 365 application is Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
