# What's new or changed in on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.2 with platform update 12 (March 2018)

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in on-premises deployments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.2 with platform update 12. This deployment option became available in March 2018.

For more resources about on-premises deployments, see [On-premises deployment landing page](../../dev-itpro/deployment/on-premises-deployment-landing-page.md).

## Setup and deployment
Improvements have been made to the setup and deployment process. These improvements significantly reduce the time that is required for deployment. Increased automation and multiple prerequisite validations have also been added to improve reliability. For more information, see [Set up and deploy on-premises environments](../../dev-itpro/deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-environments.md).

## Servicing
After your on-premises environment is deployed, you can now use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to apply platform and application updates that Microsoft releases. You can also apply code customizations. Therefore, customers can stay current with the latest set of fixes and take up new customizations without having to reconfigure an existing environment or redeploy the on-premises environment. Additionally, you can now roll back code changes if packages aren't successfully applied.

Note that the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) will remain available for environments that were deployed with platform update versions that are earlier than Platform update 12.

## Hotfixes
Hotfixes that will soon be available in LCS will provide additional features for your on-premises deployments of Platform update 12. This topic will be updated as the hotfixes become available.
