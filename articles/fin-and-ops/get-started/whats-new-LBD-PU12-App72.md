# What's new or changed in on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.2 with Platform update 12 (March 2018)

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.2 with Platform update 12. This deployment option became available in March 2018.

## Setup and deployment
Improvements have been made to the setup and deployment process. These improvements significantly reduce the time required for deployment. Increased automation and multiple pre-requisite checks have also been added to improve reliability.  For more information, see [Set up and deploy on-premises environments](../../dev-itpro/deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-environments.md).

## Servicing 
You now have the ability to apply Microsoft-released platform and application updates, as well as code customizations, to your on-premises environment after deployment through Lifecycle Services (LCS). This enables customers to stay current with the latest set of fixes as well as take new customizations without having to reconfigure an existing environment or re-deploy the on-premises environment. You are now able to rollback code changes in case package application fails. Note that the [reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) will remain available for environments deployed with Platform update versions prior to Platform update 12. 

## Hotfixes 
Hotfixes will soon be made available in Lifecycle Services (LCS) that will provide additional features for you on-premises deployments of Finance and Operations 7.2 with Platform update 12. This topic will be updated as the hotfixes become available.
