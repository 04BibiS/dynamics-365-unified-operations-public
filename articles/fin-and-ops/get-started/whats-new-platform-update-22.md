### Dynamics 365 October '18 release notes

[Check out the October '18 release notes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870424). We've captured all the details, end to end, top to bottom, in a single document that you can use for planning. 

### Platform update 22 bug fixes

## Extensibility enhancements
With Platform update 22, a third wave of platform extensibility enhancements are available. For more information, see [Platform extensibility enhancements wave 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/October18/dynamics365-finance-operations/platform-extensibility3).

## Export up to 1 million rows to Excel
The Export to Excel feature can now be configured to allow users to export up to 1 million rows from a grid in Finance and Operations. This is a substantial increase from the previous 10,000 row limit. By default, the export limit is set to 50,000 rows, but on the **Client performance options** page, system administrators can adjust the export limit to up to 1 million rows.

For more information, see [Export up to 1 million rows to Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/October18/dynamics365-finance-operations/export-more-rows).

## Improved usability of the navigation pane
The navigation pane is a highly used navigation mechanism in Finance and Operations that provides access to favorites, recently opened pages, workspaces, and notably the main menu. Because of its high usage, the navigation pane has been enhanced in a few ways to improve its usability. These changes are available starting in Platform Update 22. To learn more, see [Improved usability of the navigation pane](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/October18/dynamics365-finance-operations/updated-navigation-pane).

## Restyled personalization toolbar
The personalization toolbar has been restyled in Platform Update 22 to help users more easily tailor their own experiences in Finance and Operations. The following changes were made: 

-  The name of each personalization tool is now shown along with an icon, which helps users quickly recognize the tool they are interested in using.
-  The description for how to use the current tool is also now shown, which helps users understand how to make the desired personalizations.  
-  The entire personalization toolbar can be moved across the screen by dragging and dropping on a specific region at the far left of the toolbar. This allows users to personalize elements that were previously obscured by the toolbar.   

The following image shows how the personalization toolbar appeared before Platform update 22.
