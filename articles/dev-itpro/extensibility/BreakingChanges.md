# Breaking Changes

When making your solution extensible, you also guarantee to not break those extension point going forward. A breaking change is anything that can break a consumer of your code.

Below is a list of some types of changes that could potentially break someone. 

>DISCLAIMER: This is not an exhaustive list - there could be other types of changes that are not listed here below that could be breaking changes. Reach out to the Extensibility team in case of any doubts.

## Data model changes

### General
#### Any data model change, that requires a data upgrade script to be executed
  + Consumers may not be able to synchronize their data model
  + Consumers might loose access to data.
  
#### Data Types
  + Changing an Enum from **Extensible to not Extensible**
    - Consumers could have extensions to the enum
  + Changing an Enum from not Extensible to Extensible
    - Consumers could be using the enums in comparisons.
  - Decreasing the decimal precision of a real type EDT
	    - Consumers could have dependencies on the ability to enter data with the precision
	- Decreasing the size of string type EDT
	    - Consumers could have dependencies on the size of the string
	- Specializing the EDT by making it extend another EDT
	    - Consumers could have string length or decimals precision extension to the EDT
	- Changing the Enum type of a Enum type EDT when the Enum is extensible 
      - Consumers could have extensions to the Enum
 
Data model
	• Obsoleting a table and stop populating the table
		○ Consumers could have a dependency on the table being populated.
	• Obsoleting a table field and stop populating the field
		○ Consumers could have a dependency on the field being populated.
	• Renaming a field group
		○ Consumers could have extensions to the field group
		○ Consumers could have code or metadata dependency to the field group
	• Changes to constraints or indexes
	• Obsoleting a table map and stop leveraging the table map
	• Obsoleting a table map field
	• Adding a table map field
	• Removing a table map field mapping
	• Obsoleting a data entity
	• Obsoleting a data entity field
