# Forms

## Methods on forms:
+ The guidelines for writing extensible methods also applies in general to form methods.
+ CoC give access to the form non private members, the same as for classes.
+ CoC is enabled for nested classes which implies that methods defined within various levels on the form is extensible.

> One limitation to this is for form data source methods - only methods defined in the kernel are enabled for extensions. The ability to extend methods defined on the form datasource will be available in one of the coming platform updates.

## Field groups:
+ Consider using field groups whenever possible, this way ISVs get their fields added for free when they extend a field group.

## Form controls:
+ Moving around form controls could potentially break, if the controls are now made non-extensible by moving.
