# Write extensible forms

## Methods on forms
+ The guidelines for writing extensible methods generally apply to form methods.
+ Chain of Command (CoC) gives access to the form non-private members, which is the same as for classes.
+ CoC is enabled for nested classes which implies that methods defined within various levels on the form are extensible.

> [!NOTE]
> One limitation to this is related to form data source methods. Only methods that are defined in the kernel are enabled for extensions.

## Field groups
Consider using field groups whenever possible. This will allow ISVs to add their fields for free when they extend a field group.

## Form controls
Moving around form controls could potentially break if the controls are made non-extensible by moving.
