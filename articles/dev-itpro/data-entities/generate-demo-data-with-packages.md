# Generate demo data by using data packages

Demo data has been delivered as a database in prior releases. Starting in the Fall 2017 release, a subset of the demo data with changes will also be released in LCS as data packages in the shared asset library. These packages are designed to be loaded onto an empty environment and you can choose which packages that you need to load for your demonstration. 

Using data packages to deliver demo data provides some benefits over using the current database:
1. The download times are signficantly faster.
2. You can import only the data packages that you need.
3. You can edit the spreadsheets to customize the data for your customers. 
4. Updated demo data can be provided through LCS very quickly.

## How the packages are organized

The demo data packages are designed to be layered on top of each other as shown in this diagram:

### System and shared
The base package, **System and Shared**, is the foundation for all other packages. This package creates the legal entities, loads the global address book, and adds additional shared information. It must be loaded first to support all of the remaining packages. The package is entitled "100 - System and Shared.zip"

Once the package is loaded, you will have the following legal entities:

| Legal entity | Description |  
|------|--------|
| HQUS | The US based headquarters for your demo company. This company was based on the original USMF data but changed to remove the manufacturing focus in the name. It includes setup information intended for US companies.|
| HQEU | The non-US based headquarters for your demo company. This company was based on the original DEMF data but changed to remove the manufacturing focus in the name. It includes setup information intended for non-US companies.|
| CONS | A small consolidations company. |
| PICH | A process industries company focused on chemicals. |
| PIFB | A process industries company focused on food and beverage. |

### Financials
The **Financial** data packages contain data for general ledger, bank, accounts payable, tax, accounts receivable, fixed assets, and budgeting for a single company. These data packages are entitled "200 - Financials" followed by the legal entity for which they were intended. For examples, the financial data packages for HQUS are entitled "200 - Financials - HQUS.zip".

At least two financials companies are required for cross company tasks such as centralized payments. All customers and vendors have been added to each legal entity to facilitate the cross company tasks. The CONS company is required if you want to do consolidations. 

The financial data packages also have five inventory products to support the creation of invoices that will move through the accounts receivables and accounts payables processes. These items use a minimum of inventory and product functionality to support those process while eliminating complexity of setting up products when you want to demonstrate only financials functionality. More complete products will be added when you import the supply chain packages.  

### Supply chain
The **Supply chain** data packages contain data for      abc       for a single company. These data packages are entitled "300 - Supply Chain 1 of 2" followed by the legal entity for which they were intended. For examples, the supply chain data packages for HQUS are entitled "300 - Supply Chain 1 of 2- HQUS.zip".

Due to the large number of entities, the supply chain packages have been split up into two packages. Both packages must be loaded to complete the supply chain scenarios. 

## Demo data package releases
The demo data packages will be released via LCS and matched to the release for which they were intended. Please note that the contents of the packages are subject to change as we add more demo scenarios and tune the packages. Additional packages will also be released when we add additional module areas and industry specific scenarios. These packages are not yet a full replacement for the demo database that is supplied today.

## Steps to take before loading packages

There are some steps that you will need to do manually before you load the data. 
1) If you want to login as a specific user, you will need to change the user's email address to the login address that you want to use. You can make that change in the User information data entity spreadsheet or, after loading data, in the System administration, Users form.
2) You will need to start the Workflow jobs. Use System administration, Workflow infrastructure configuration and click on Ok. The workflow jobs will be started.
3) The Ready to post scheduler must be started. This batch will post transactions automatically. Follow the steps described for Ready to Post below.
4) You need to set up policy precedence rules. Use Procurement and sourcing, Setup, Policies, Purchasing policies and select the Parameters menu item. Click on Companies and move it to the right hand column.

## Loading the packages

The data packages must be loaded in a specific order into a specific legal entity. The number preceding the name of the package provides guidance to the order that the data must be loaded. For example, to load the the HQUS financials, you must import "100 - System and shared.zip" first, followed by "200 - Financials - HQUS.zip". If you want to add supply chain data to the HQUS company, add "300 - Supply chain - HQUS.zip". The name of the package will also include the release for which it was intended.

Follow these steps to load the packages:
1) Start with an empty instance where no data is loaded
2) Open the data management workspace
3) Click on the Import tile to create an import job
4) Add a title to the job. For example, "Import shared information"
5) Select "Add file" 
6) Select "Upload and add" and browse to the data package that you want to import. You will need to start with the System and Shared data package.
7) Select the data package and wait for the data to load
8) Once the data is loaded, close the dialogue and click on Import 
9) Repeat the process for additional packages. Be sure to change to the company for which the data package was intended. For example, switch to the HQUS company before importing the data package

### Loading package combinations
The following packages are available to load:

| Description | Notes |  
|------|--------|
| 2017 Fall release - 100 - SystemAndShared | This must be loaded before any package.|  
| 2017 Fall release - 200 - Financials - HQUS | This can be loaded alone or with another financials package. |  
| 2017 Fall release - 200 - Financials - HQEU | This can be loaded alone or with another financials package. |  
| 2017 Fall release - 200 - Financials - CONS | This can be loaded alone or with another financials package. |  
| 2017 Fall release - 200 - Financials - PICH | This can be loaded alone or with another financials package. |  
| 2017 Fall release - 200 - Financials - PIFB | This can be loaded alone or with another financials package. |  

### Steps to take after loading packages
In some cases, there may be data that you want to add due to a special scenario or missing entity. Add that data at this time. You may also want to manually post additional transactions or add your own data packages to enhance the demo experience.

### Scenario scripts
Scripts have been provided for many of the scenarios supported by the demo data. You can find those scripts here: [Demo data scripts for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, Enterprise Edition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=861599).

## Transactions and automatic posting
Many scenarios for demo data require that transactions be processed after they are imported. You can process transactions using the Ready to post feature, which includes both a form that allows you to define which transactions should be posted and an entity that allows you to import the definitions and automatically execute them. 

The following transaction types are supported for posting demo data:

| Document | Date filter | ID filters | Other filters |  
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Budget registry update | Default Date | Budget entry number | Not in use, Status = Draft. |
| Costing version | n/a | Version Id | Version Activation blocked = No. | 
| Customer payment journal | n/a | Journal number | Not posted, not workflow, not system blocked. | 
| Daily journal | n/a | Journal number | Not posted, not workflow, not system blocked. |
| Fixed assets journal | n/a | Journal number | Not posted, not workflow, not system blocked. |
| Free text invoice | Invoice Date | n/a |  |
| Inventory adjustment journal | n/a | Journal number | Not posted. |
| Invoice journal | n/a | Journal number | Not posted, not workflow, not system blocked. |
| Price calculation| n/a | Version Id | Version Activation blocked = No. |
| Purchase order | Delivery date | Purchase order id | Able to confirm/PR/Vendor confirm/invoice. |
| Sales Order | Delivery date | Sales order id | Able to confirm/packing slip/invoice. |
| Trade agreement | n/a | Price/discount journal number. |  |
| Vendor invoice | Posting date | Invoice number | Approved, not in use, not yet . |
| Vendor payment journal | n/a | Journal number | Not posted, not workflow, not system blocked. |

### The Ready to post process
The Ready to post feature uses a batch to monitor the list of transaction types that you want to post. Once the monitor detects a transaction that you want to post, it uses the transaction type to generate a batch that posts those transactions. The batch is the same batch that is used when you click on the button in the user interface for that transaction that initiates an action such as Post or Invoice. Once the transaction batch is complete, the Ready to post monitor updates the list with the results of the processing and with links to the batch and the original transaction.

### Use the Ready to post form to process transactions
You can access the Ready to post form using System administration, Periodic tasks, Batch job ready to post. 

To create a Ready to post job, follow these steps:
1) Select the Create posting monitor menu and set up the batch parameters so that you have a recurring batch running. You only have to do this step once to initiate the posting batch process.
2) Select New and enter a name for the demo data job
3) Use Add line to add a transaction type. 
4) Select the transaction target. For journals, it is Post. For other transactions, it may change depending on the transaction type.
4) Specify a start and end date range to limit the transactions that will be processed (when available)
5) Specify a from and to document range to limit the transactions that will be processed (when available)
6) Use Add line to add additional transaction types. You can use the same type on multiple lines.
7) Click on the menu Mark ready to post. It will change the status from Open to Ready and the posting monitor will start processing each line.
8) If you want to process the document immediately, click on the Process documents menu. The batch status will change to Submitted and a batch will be started without using the posting monitor.
9) When the batch is complete, the status will change to Complete. The posting results will be displayed at the bottom of the form.

### Using the Ready to post entity to process transactions
An entity called Demo data posting entity allows you to import a list of document types that you want to post. The entity will create a demo data job in the Ready to post form and you can follow the steps above to process the transactions. If you update the value for PROCESSONIMPORT to be Yes in your data package spreadsheet, the demo data job will be set to Ready and the process monitor will pick it up without any action required.
