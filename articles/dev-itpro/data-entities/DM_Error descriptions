# Data management error description

### Import to target failed due to an update conflict as more than one process is
trying to update the same record at the same time

This error can happen in one or more of the following scenarios.

-   When using recurring imports (enqueue API), if the files are sent to the end
    point at high frequency, data management will try to process the files in
    parallel if sequential processing of messages was not enabled. When files
    are processed in parallel, there are chances to run into this error when
    multiple files have the same record which results in multiple threads trying
    to update the same record at the same time. If this is a data issue, you
    must fix the data such that the same records donâ€™t repeat across files. If
    this is not a data issue and the entity is expected to handle such cases,
    then the mitigation is to either sequentially process the files or reduce
    the frequency at which the files are sent to the end point. The latter might
    still run into this error as it eventually depends on the timing.
