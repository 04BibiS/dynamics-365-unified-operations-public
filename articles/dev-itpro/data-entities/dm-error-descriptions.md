# Data management error descriptions

## Import to target failed due to an update conflict as more than one process is
trying to update the same record at the same time

This error can happen in one or more of the following scenarios.

When you use recurring imports (enqueue API), if the files are sent to the end point at high frequency and the sequential processing of messages isn't enabled, data management will try to process the files in parallel. This error could occur when files are processed in parallel if multiple files have the same record which results in multiple threads trying to update the same record at the same time. If this is a data issue, you must update the data so that the same records donâ€™t repeat across files. If this is not a data issue and the entity is expected to handle such cases, then you can chose to sequentially process the files or reduce the frequency of which the files are sent to the end point. However, if you chose the latter, you might still run in to this errordepending on the timing.
