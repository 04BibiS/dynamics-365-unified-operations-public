# Data management error descriptions
This article documents the scenarios when a specific error will be seen. This is not a complete list of errors and scenarios since this list will be continuously updated. Any feedback on this page with regards to specific errors that must be covered first over others are welcome. We will strive to priorotize these messages before others.

This topic describes the error messages that you might encounter in data management.

## Import to target failed due to an update conflict as more than one process is trying to update the same record at the same time
When you use recurring imports (enqueue API), if the files are sent to the end point at high frequency and the sequential processing of messages isn't enabled, data management will try to process the files in parallel. 
When files are processed in parallel, and multiple files have the same record, multiple threads will try to update the same record at the same time. 
If this is a data issue, you must update the data so that the same records donâ€™t repeat across files. 
If this is not a data issue and the entity is expected to handle such cases, you can chose to sequentially process the files or reduce the frequency of which the files are sent to the end point. However, if you reduce the frequency, you might continue to receive this error, depending on the timing.

## There are field(s) which are not mapped to Entity - <Entity Name>
It is a common practice to use the export functionality to generate the entity template file which can be later used for imports. However, while exporting the template, in fixed width format with 'First row header' set to 'No' (in source data formats set up), the exported template will not have the column names. When such a file is later imported, it will result in this error.
