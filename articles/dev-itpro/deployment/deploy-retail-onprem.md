# Installation steps for Retail channel components in an on-premises envionrment

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article will cover installation steps for Retail channel components in an on-prem envionrment. 

Overview

Retail channel functionality, in an on prem environment, is enabled exclusively via use of Retail Store Scale Unit. Here is an overview of Retail Store Scale Unit (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/retail-store-system-begin). Unlike in a cloud deployment, an on-prem enviornment does not enable seamless high availability deployment of Retail channel components via LCS. The only way to use Retail channel components is via installation of Retail Store Scale Unit. 

Pre-requisites
Before you can start installation of Retail channel components, you must first complete all prior installation steps for an on-prem enviornment as listed here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-environments).
