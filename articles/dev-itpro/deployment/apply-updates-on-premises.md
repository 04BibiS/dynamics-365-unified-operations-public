# Apply updates to an on-premises deployment

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about how to apply supported updates to an on-premises environment of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. Any updates that are made to an on-premises environment are done through Lifecycle Services (LCS). 


## Update types
There are four kinds of updates that can be applied to an on-premises deployment of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations: 
- Customizations 
- Application hotfixes released by Microsoft  
- Latest platform update  
- Application binary updates  
Currently, only the application of customizations and hotfixes to an on-premises environment are supported. 

## Code customizations
To apply customizations at the same time that you deploy a new on-premises environment, follow the steps in the topic, [Develop and deploy custom models to on-premises environments](develop-deploy-custom-models-on-premises.md). To apply new customizations on an already deployed environment, complete the following steps: 

1. In Lifecycle Services, navigate to the on-premises implementation project.  
2. Under **Environments**, click **Delete** to delete the application. This will clean up and remove any code that is deployed. When you click **Delete**, you do not impact the infrastructure.

3. After the environment is deleted, click **Configure** to re-deploy with a new application and custom code.  
4. In the **Advanced settings** of the deployment configuration flow, select the application deployable package to apply, and then click **Done** to continue with the environment deployment process.  

## Find and apply application hotfixes
There are two ways to find available application hotfixes: 
- Issue Search in Lifecycle Services - To learn more about issue search, see [Issue search](../lifecycle-services/issue-search-lcs.md.  
- **Application hotfix** tiles - For cloud-hosted environments, the **Environment details** page shows all of the hotfixes that are applicable to that environment based on the version that is currently deployed. The tile functionality is not available for on-premises environments, so if a customer wants to see the list of applicable hotfixes, a cloud-hosted development environment should be maintained on the same version as the on-premises sandbox or production environment.   

Complete the following steps to apply the hotfix.

1.Download the required hotfix to your development environment, and then follow the steps in the article, Create a deployable package (create-apply-deployable-package.md).  
2. After you have the deployable package, upload the package to the Lifecycle Services Asset library on the **Software deployable packages** tab.  
Similar to applying code customizations, you can include the deployable package as an asset during environment deployment flow. 
3. In the **Advanced settings** of the **Configure deployment flow**, click **Configure**, select the application deployable package to apply, and then click **Done** to continue with the environment deployment process. 

To apply hotfixes to an already deployed environment, complete steps 1 and 2 listed above. Next, navigate to the project dashboard and click **Delete** to delete the deployed application. Then follow step 3 to deploy the hotfix.
