# Configure reverse proxy for your Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises environment

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Customers may want to secure the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises environment behind a reverse proxy. Reverse proxy is a server that hides the actual servers serving traffic from the clients. The proxy server accepts requests from the clients on behalf of the F&O environment and forwards the traffic to it. The clients are not aware of the actual servers that compose the F&O environment. This adds a measure of security and enable load balancing. 

## Steps to configure the reverse proxy

Perform the below steps in **each** node of type OrchestratorType in the Service Fabric cluster
1. Remote into the Orchestrator VM
2. Execute the below powershell script to retrive the path of the ```machine.config``` file

	```Powershell
	[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::SystemConfigurationFile
	```

3. Edit the ```machine.config``` file to add the below xml snippet

	```XML
		<system.net>
			<defaultProxy enabled="true" >
				<proxy <<<SET YOUR PROXY SETTINGS>> />
	   	 </defaultProxy>
    	</system.net>
	```

4. Save the file.
5. Restart the machine.
