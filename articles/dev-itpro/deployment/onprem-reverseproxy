#Configure Reverse proxy for your Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations On-premises environment

Customers may want to secure the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises environment behind a reverse proxy. Reverse proxy is a server that hides the actual servers serving traffic from the clients. The proxy server accepts requests from the clients on behalf of the F&O environment and forwards the traffic to it. The clients are not aware of the actual servers that compose the F&O environment. This adds a measure of security and enable load balancing. 

##Steps to configure the reverse proxy
Perform the below steps in **each** node of type OrchestratorType in the Service Fabric cluster
1. Remote into the Orchestrator VM
2. Execute the below powershell script to retrive the path of the ```machine.config``` file
```Powershell
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::SystemConfigurationFile
```
3. Edit the ```machine.config``` file to add the below xml snippet
```
	<system.net>
		<defaultProxy enabled="true" >
			<proxy <<<SET YOUR PROXY SETTINGS>> />
	    </defaultProxy>
    </system.net>
```
4. Save the file.
5. Restart the machine.
