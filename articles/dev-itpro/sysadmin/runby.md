# Batch Manager Role 

Previously, users needed to have the Sysadmin/IT Admin security Role in order to manage batch job, We have provided a more targeted role, Batch Manager, which grants users the permission to copy batch, change who will execute jobs and specify time ranges during which jobs can execute. 

Uses

## Run By user

This functionality gives Batch Managers the ability to specify a specific User to run the Batch Job. This is very useful when you want to

- Change the Current User who runs the Job if they are no longer active
- Quickly set a user while copying the Batch Jobs from a company to another
