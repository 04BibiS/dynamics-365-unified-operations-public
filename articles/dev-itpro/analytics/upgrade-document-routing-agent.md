# Upgrade the Document Routing Agent

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To update the Document Routing Agent, complete the following steps on **each machine where the Document Routing Agent is
installed**.

> [!Important]
> If the Document Routing Agent is running as Windows service,  make sure that the service account information (user name and password) is available. This will need to be used after the Document Routing Agent is upgraded. The service account information can be obtained by opening the **Services** window and finding the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Document Routing Service**.

    Open the **Programs and Features** window, and then find and uninstall **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations: Document Routing**.

    During the uninstallation, the below window might be shown. Choose **Automatically close applications and attempt to restart them after setup is complete.**
