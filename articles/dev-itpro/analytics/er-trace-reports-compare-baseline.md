# Trace generated report results and compare with baseline values

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

With using the existing functionality of the Electronic reporting (ER) framework, you can trace the results of the execution of ER formats that generate outgoing electronic documents. When the trace generation mode is turned on, a new trace record is created in the ER formats execution log for each executed ER report. The following details are stored in each generated trace:
-	All warnings that have been generated by validation rules which designed in the executed ER format to be recorded in such trace;
-	All errors that have been generated by validation rules which designed in the executed ER format to be recorded in such trace;
-	Generated files are stores as attachments of the created trace record.

With new ER framework functionality, for any ER format you can store in your application individual files that can be considered as baselines that describe the expected results of such reports execution. When such baseline is available for an ER format that has been executed with the turned-on trace generation mode, in addition to the details mentioned above the result of the comparison of the generated electronic document vs. baseline is stored in the created trace. You can also get the generated electronic document and its baseline by one click in one single zipped file for detailed comparison â€“ any external tool can be used for that (WINDIFF, etc.).
Using this function, you can evaluate the trace of ER reports execution to analyze whether generated electronic documents has been created with the expected content. It can be performed (in unattended mode, for many ER reports) in an UAT environment when the code base has been changed (you migrated to a new instance of the application, installed hotfix packages, deployed your code modifications, etc.) to make sure that it does not affect the execution of using ER reports.
To learn more about this feature, play the task guides ER Trace reports execution and compare results vs baseline (Part 1) and ER Trace reports execution and compare results vs baseline (Part 2) (parts of the 7.5.4.3 Test IT services/solutions (10679) business process), which walk through how the ER framework can be configured to use baseline files for evaluation of generated electronic documents.
