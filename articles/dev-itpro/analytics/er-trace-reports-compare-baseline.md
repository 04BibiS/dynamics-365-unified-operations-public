# Trace generated report results and compare with baseline values

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can trace the results of ER formats that generate outgoing electronic documents. When Trace generation is turned on, a new trace record is created in the ER formats execution log each time an ER report is run. The following details are stored in each generated trace:
-	All warnings generated by validation rules
-	All errors that have been generated by validation rules 
-	All generated files that are stored as attachments of the trace record

You can store individual baseline application files in any ER format. Files are considered baseline when they describe the expected results of executed reports. When the baseline is available for an ER format that has been executed while trace generation is turned on, in addition to the details mentioned above, the result of the comparison of the generated electronic document to the baseline is stored in the created trace. You can also get the generated electronic document and it's baseline by one click in one single zipped file for detailed comparison â€“ any external tool can be used for that (WINDIFF, etc.).
You can evaluate the trace to analyze whether generated electronic documents have been created with the expected content. It can be performed (in unattended mode, for many ER reports) in an UAT environment when the code base has been changed (you migrated to a new instance of the application, installed hotfix packages, deployed your code modifications, etc.) to make sure that it does not affect the execution of using ER reports.
To learn more about this feature, play the task guides ER Trace reports execution and compare results vs baseline (Part 1) and ER Trace reports execution and compare results vs baseline (Part 2) (parts of the 7.5.4.3 Test IT services/solutions (10679) business process), which walk through how the ER framework can be configured to use baseline files for evaluation of generated electronic documents.
