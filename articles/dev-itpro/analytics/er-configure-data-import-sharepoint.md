# Configure data import from SharePoint

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you need to import data using the Electronic reporting (ER) framework, you must configure an ER format that supports the import and then run the model mapping destination that uses the format as a data source. When you want to import data from Microsoft SharePoint, you must manually browse the local folders of SharePoint to locate the file for import.
You can use your ER configurations to set up data import from files that are stored in SharePoint folders. This topic explains how to complete the import by using vendor transactions as business data that must be imported to the application.
