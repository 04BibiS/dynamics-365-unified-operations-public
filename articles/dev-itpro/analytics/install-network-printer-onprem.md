    2.  Install network printers by using AXService user account. This step
        ensures the printer driver is available to AXService user account.

    3.  Print a test page with installed printers to make sure all the
        connections are configured correctly.

    4.  Restart AXService application to ensure the user’s profile is loaded
        correctly to look up printer driver.

AX Administrator:

1.  Open the Manage network printers page (Organization administration \> Setup
    \> Network printers).

2.  Add new printers by providing printer Name, Description, Path and Status.
    Make sure the printer path matches the network path of the installed
    printer.
