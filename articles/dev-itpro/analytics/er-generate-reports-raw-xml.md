# Generate ER reports by adding content as raw xml

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can design Electronic reporting (ER) formats to generate outgoing documents in xml format by using the new format element, RAW XML. 
In some cases, you may find that you prefer to raw xml data to these reports for one or more of the following reasons:

- It is more convenient to use raw xml for the initial design and ongoing maintenance of a report as the xml structure can be automatically generated by executing a run-time expression instead of having to generate multiple bindings for multiple format elements at design-time. 
- You are using data sources that contain information that can be used to make xml elements while the report is being generated. 
- It is the only way to populate to your report the xml content that have been previously received and stored in the system. For example, when the generated xml response must contain the content of the previously sent xml request 
- It is the only way to place to the generated document characters based on their numeric codes. For some languages and characters, such codes don’t exist, for example, Greek ρ or HTML entity codes like &eacute for accented é.

>[!NOTE]
>Be aware that the framework does not control whether the xml content in the generated document is correct.

To learn more about this feature, play the task guides **Generate xml reports by adding content as raw xml (Part 1: Design data model)** and **Generate xml reports by adding content as raw xml (Part 2: Design and run report)**, parts of the **7.5.4.3 Acquire/Develop IT service/solution components (10677) business process**, which walk through how an Electronic Reporting format can be configured to place raw xml data in generated files.
