# Generate ER reports by adding content as raw xml

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can design Electronic reporting (ER) formats to generate outgoing documents in xml format. In some cases, you may find that you prefer to add data, such as raw xml data, to these reports. This might happen if it is more convenient to use raw xml for the initial design of a report and ongoing report maintenance because the xml structure can be automatically generated by executing an ER expression at run-time instead of having to generate multiple bindings for multiple format elements at design-time

When you use data sources that contain information that can be used to make xml elements while the report is being generated, 
-	It is the only way when you need to populate to your report the xml content that have been previously received and stored in the system
    - For example, when the generated xml response must contain the content of the previously sent xml request 
-	It is the only way to place to the generated document characters based on their numeric codes
    - For some languages and some characters such codes don’t exist (for example, Greek ρ or HTML entity codes like &eacute for accented é)

Now you can design ER formats to generate electronic documents by placing in them data as raw xml.  The new format element of the RAW XML type can be used for that.

  >[!NOTE]
  >Be aware that the ER framework does not control the correctness of the xml content that has been placed to the generated document by using the format element of the RAW XML type.

To learn more about this feature, play the task guides ER Generate xml reports by adding content as raw xml (Part 1: Design data model).xml and ER Generate xml reports by adding content as raw xml (Part 2: Design and run report).xml  (parts of the 7.5.4.3 Acquire/Develop IT service/solution components (10677) business process), which walk through how an ER format can be configured to place raw xml data to generated files.
