# Scheduling Entity Store model updates

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

TARGET:  **Platform Update 16 or later**

### REFRSHING MODELS
System administrators use built-in tools to manage the frequency at which data models are refreshed with the latest updates available in the transactional database.  Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations supports both a Full and Incremental synchronization strategy that may be used in concert to keep models up-to-date:
- **Full-Synchronization** - existing data in the Entity Store is deleted and the entire model is materialized during the background process
- **Incremental refresh** - updates to transactional database including object deletes are synchronized with the Entity Store models
	
It is the responsibility of the System administrator to manage the Entity Store model refresh schedule based on the unique needs of the deployment.  The built-in tooling provides detailed messaging based on run-time analysis of the models to help identify cases where a full-synchronization is required to ensure the entire model is synchronized with the latest updates available in the Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations transactional database.

### ADMINISTRATOR TASKS
This section describes the activities associated with managing Entity Store models using the built-in administration tools.

#### Performing a full synchronization
The first thing you'll want to do after bringing the environment online is identify the models which are required by the application.  It's incorrect to assume that all of the models are necessary to avoid wasting time updating unused models.  See the article [Power BI content](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/power-bi-home-page) in Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations to familiarize yourself with the out-of-box solutions available in the Application Suite.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  We highly recommend that you **DISABLE** synchronization for both the **ProjecCostRevenueAnalysis** and **VendPaymentBIMeasure** Entity Store models.  Both of these application models have been flagged for poor performance during the synchronization process.  Use the following steps to perform a full-synchronization of the Entity Store for the models used by the application.

**Steps:**
1) Navigate to the **Entity Store** management form **[System administration > Setup > Entity Store]**
2) Select the Entity Store models related to all areas accessible in the application
3) Click the **Refresh** button in the header
4) Click the **OK** button in the **Configure refresh** dialog
	
This process may take up to an hour depending on the size and breadth of the application deployment.  You can track the status of the background synchronization process by visiting the Batch jobs area and searching for jobs with a description like **Deploy measurement**.  Once complete, you can begin to use the Entity Store model for Embedded Analytical Workspaces & Reports as well as reports hosted on PowerBI.com.

#### Start the Incremental Refresh processing engine
After performing the initial full-synchronization process, you're ready to begin adjusting the model refresh schedule to better accommodate users' interactions with reports and embedded analytics.  The Incremental Refresh engine runs in the background using a system Batch job.  System Administrators must start the process to utilize the Incremental Refresh option.  Use the following steps to turn-on the Incremental refresh engine for models.

**Steps:**
1) Navigate to the **Change based alerts** management form **[System administration > Setup > Alerts > Change based alerts]**
2) Click on **Run in the background** to expand the Batch job options
3) Toggle the **Batch processing** radio button to **True** to enable the background processing
4) Click on the **Recurrence** text to establish the processing frequency
5) Select the **NO END DATE** radio button option
6) Under **RECURRENCE PATTERN** select the processing frequency

**RECOMMENDATION:**  Start with a recurring pattern of **10 minutes** and refine as needed.  Try to avoid selecting a frequency that doesn't allow for an incremental process to complete.

Here's a screen shot of the dialog used to manage the frequency of the Incremental refresh processing engine

Once the processing engine is initialized, you're ready to begin enbling select models for Incremental refresh.


#### Activate Incremental Refresh option for selected models
After performing the initial full-synchronization process, you're ready to begin adjusting the model refresh schedule to better accommodate users' interactions with reports and embedded analytics.  You'll want to enable the Incremental Refresh option for those models that contain data that must be refreshed more often than once a day.  For starters, it's best to keep the default latency settings used to trigger a full-synchronization.  Use the following steps to turn-on the Incremental Refresh option for a given Entity Store model

**Steps:**
1) Navigate to the **Entity Store** management form **[System administration > Setup > Entity Store]**
2) Select the Entity Store models related to all areas accessible in the application
3) Click the **Edit** button in the header
4) Check the box in the **Incremental updates** column to enable Incremental refresh option

**NOTE:**  Select a latency for those models that are most often used to deliver near real-time results.

Congratulations, you are now using the Incremental Refresh option to deliver more up-to-date information for Reporting and Analytical scenarios in Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations.
