# Validate an application for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the requirements that are used to verify that custom code meets Microsoft guidelines, and that a Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution package can be successfully deployed in a Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations environment. 

Microsoft requires specific reviews in order to validate the following requirements:

-   A partner's custom code meets Microsoft guidelines.
-   A Microsoft Dynamics LCS solution package can be successfully deployed.
-   Transactions can be completed.

Currently, partners must demonstrate that these requirements have been met by doingÂ test deployments and then sharing the results with Microsoft. No code will be deployed on a customer environment that Microsoft hasn't validated. Partners must complete the following curation artifacts and tests:

-   Code analysis report (CAR)
-   Business process modeler (BPM)/test scripts
-   Business database backup
-   Project name and description
-   Data packages and Process data packages (PDPs)
-   Methodology (optional)
-   Binaries (optional)
-   Deployable packages
-   Models (code and tests)
-   Marketing content

### Curation meeting

The following table describes the steps that must be completed before the validation meeting.

| Data packages and PDPs       | All data packages should be loaded into LCS before the validation meeting. You should be able to modify the data packages and load them into an empty environment. By using only data packages and a user, you should be able to run business processes that are in the BPM library. |
| Methodology                  | The methodology should incorporate an overview of the product. Guided experience to Conference Room Pilot 1 (CRP1) and any implementation methodology specifically tailored for the partner's solution are optional. |

The logo should be industry-specific and should not include your company name. The description should be aligned with your business processes.                            |


## Update and maintenance requirements
If you have a curated solution that is published on AppSource, you must keep the solution up to date. After each release in the Spring and Fall, you will have six weeks to upgrade your code. You must update and test the following artifacts:

-   CAR
-   Models (code and tests)
-   Deployable packages
-   BPM/test scripts
-   Data packages and PDPs
-   Business database backup

### Maintenance process steps
