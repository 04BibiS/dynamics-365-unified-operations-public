# Upgrade from AX 2012 - Cutover process (Go live)

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

*Cutover* is the term that we use for the final process of getting a new system live. This cutover process consists of the tasks that occur after Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 is turned off but before Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, is turned on. Before you plan your final cutover, you need to successfully complete one successful mock cutover as described in [Cutover testing](./upgrade-cutover-testing.md)

The following illustration shows the overall process for cutover to go-live as it will occur in the production environment.
