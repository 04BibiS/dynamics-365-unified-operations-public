# Download updates from Lifecycle Services

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use this tutorial to download updates from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

## Types of updates

- **Binary updates** are pre-compiled and cumulative. Every subsequent binary update includes all previous updates. These updates don't have to be compiled in a development environment, and they can be applied directly to a non-development environment from LCS.
        
    If you're running an environment that has retail functionality and a customized instance of Cloud point of sale (POS), you must complete the additional steps that are listed under Retail SDK packaging. For Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail, all updates, even updates for application models, are released as binary updates.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your environment is on Platform Update 4 and above, you will have the option to download **All binary updates** and **Platform binary updates** from the LCS **Environment** page.  
    > - The **All binary updates** tile includes a combined package of application and platform binary updates.  
    > - The **Platform binary updates** tile includes the latest platform only updates or hotfixes. 
    

- **X++ updates** include updates to specific application functionality in application models. These updates can be independently downloaded and applied. You can select specific X++ updates to apply to your environment.  Dependent X++ updates are automatically selected and downloaded.  Any X++ updates are source code updates, before they can be applied to a non-development environment, they must be compiled in a developer environment and merged with any customizations. X++ updates apply only to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > For online environments, you will see both the **All X++ updates** tile and the **Critical X++ updates** tile. The Critical X++ updates are recommended KBs that are based on the telemetry data in **your production environment**.  
    >
    > To test and apply any X++ updates, after download the X++ updates, apply them in a development environment to build a deployable package, and then apply the deployable package to your sandbox and then production environments. 
    >
    > For more information about deploying updates, see [Apply updates to a cloud environment](../deployment/apply-deployable-package-system.md)  

## Download updates

To view available updates:
1. Sign in to LCS by using your credentials.
2. In the LCS project, select an environment.
3. On the **Environment** page, the **Monitoring** section includes update tiles. 

   >[!NOTE]
   > For Retail, you will see tile for binary updates only. For Finance and Operations, you will see tiles for both X++ updates and binary updates. These two types of updates can be independently downloaded and applied. However, some X++ updates might depend on binary updates, and some binary updates might depend on X++ updates. Any dependencies are included in the update description.
