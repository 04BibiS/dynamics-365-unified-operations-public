# Download updates from Lifecycle Services

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use this tutorial to download updates from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

## Types of updates

- **Binary updates** are pre-compiled and cumulative. Every subsequent binary update includes all previous updates. These updates don't have to be compiled in a development environment, and they can be applied directly to a non-development environment from LCS.
        
    If you're running an environment that has retail functionality and a customized instance of Cloud point of sale (POS), you must complete the additional steps that are listed under Retail SDK packaging. For Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail, all updates, even updates for application models, are released as binary updates.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your environment is on Platform Update 4 and above, you will have the option to download **All binary udpates** and **Platform binary updates** from the LCS **Environment** page.  
    > - The **All binary updates** tile includes a combined package of application and platform binary updates.  
    > - The **Platform binary updates** tile includes the latest platform only updates or hotfixes. 
    

- **X++ updates** include updates to specific application functionality in application models. These updates can be independently downloaded and applied. You can select specific X++ updates to apply to your environment. Any dependent X++ updates are then automatically selected and downloaded. X++ updates are source code updates. Before they can be applied to a non-development environment, they must be compiled in a developer environment and merged with any customizations. X++ updates apply only to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  In your production environment, you will have the the **All X++ updates** tile and the **Critical X++ updates** tile.  The Critical X++ updates are recommended KBs based on the telemetry data in your production environment, they are specifically to your production environment, and can be downloaded only from your production environment.  
    > - The **All X++ updates** tile includes all application X++ updates that are available to an environment.
    > - The **Critical X++ updates** tile is only available in the production environment, it includes recommended application X++ updates that are available specifically to your production environment.
    

## Download updates

To view available updates:
1. Sign in to LCS by using your credentials.
2. In the LCS project, select an environment.
3. On the **Environment** page, the **Monitoring** section includes update tiles. 

   >[!NOTE]
   > For Retail, you will see tile for binary updates only. For Finance and Operations, you will see tiles for both X++ updates and binary updates. These two types of updates can be independently downloaded and applied. However, some X++ updates might depend on binary updates, and some binary updates might depend on X++ updates. Any dependencies are included in the update description.
