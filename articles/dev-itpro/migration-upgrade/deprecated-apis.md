# Deprecated APIs in Finance and Operations

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This document provides the list of deprecated APIs and migration guidance for some of the deprecated APIs.

## Overview

A number of APIs from Dynamics AX 2012 have been identified. The reason for the deprecation for each API varies. Most commonly, the reasons are one of the following:

- Not suited/applicable to the new client.
- Degrade performance.
- Chatty (cause lot of traffic back and forth between server and client).
- Redundant (framework automatically handles these now).

Throughout this table, under the **Reason for Deprecation** heading, "the client" refers to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Web client.

<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-13"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
These technologies will not work with the client.
<h4 id="migration-notes-13"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Application developers need to build replacement controls where needed using the control extensibility features. |

FormControl |
Method |
labelMouseDblClick mouseDblClick |
<h4 id="overview-19"><em>Overview</em></h4>
The FormControl.labelMouseDblClick (int x, int y, int button, Boolean Ctrl, Boolean Shift) method is called when the label for a control is double-clicked. It provides the x, y co-ordinates of the mouse pointer, a Boolean to indicate which mouse button was clicked and Booleans to indicate whether the Ctrl and Shift key were pressed. The FormControl.mouseDblClick (int x, int y, int button, Boolean Ctrl, Boolean Shift) method is similar in function to the labelMouseDblClick method. The difference is that this method is called whenever there is a double-click (not just on the labels).
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-18"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
The double-click action does not translate well to web-based application and touch-based scenarios. Additionally they might end up being chatty in many instances.
<h4 id="migration-notes-18"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
The recommended replacement for these methods is to use a button and the <em>clicked</em> event. |

FormDataSource |
Method |
findRecord findValue |
<h4 id="usage"><em>Usage</em></h4>
The FormDataSource.findRecord(Common record) method finds a specific record in the data source and makes it the current record. The FormDataSource.findValue(FieldId field, str value) method find a specific value in a specific field in the data source and makes the corresponding record the current record. It uses the FormDataSource.findRecord method for this.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-28"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
These methods use linear searching and load a large number of records in memory and negatively impact performance.
<h4 id="migration-notes-28"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Replace with new APIs. Replace findRecord with positionToRecord and findValue with positionToRecordByValue. New APIs do not work in some cases, most notably with Temp tables and Views. The framework will throw an exception in those cases. If replacing with new APIs is not possible, recommended replacement is to call <em>element.args().lookupRecord(recordToFind)</em> Followed by <em>FormDataSource.research(false);</em> FormDataSource is the data source that contains the record you want to find. Passing in a “false” argument to research causes it to not retain the current position since we want to change the position to the record we found using args.lookupRecord avoids resetting sort order, ranges, etc. |

<h4 id="overview-31"><em>Overview</em></h4>
These methods were used to show/stop showing a progress indicator during long running operations.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-31"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
In the client, the system automatically takes care of showing/hiding the progress indicator and calls to these APIs are not needed.
<h4 id="migration-notes-31"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
You can safely remove any calls to these APIs from your code. |

<h4 id="overview-32"><em>Overview</em></h4>
This method was used to find the active action pane tab.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-32"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
In the client, Action Pane tabs are handled client-side only, the server is not aware of the state.
<h4 id="migration-notes-32"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Remove usage of this API from your code. |

|

 |

| 
Object |
Method |
notify notifyAll wait |
<h4 id="overview-33"><em>Overview</em></h4>
Used to block and wait for an interaction/operation and notify to unblock.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-33"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
These calls are deprecated for all objects except formRun and it’s derivatives.
<h4 id="migration-notes-33"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Calls to these APIs from formRun or it’s derivatives are allowed.  Calls to these APIs from any other object should be removed. |

| 
Object |
Method |
objectOnServer |
<h4 id="overview-34"><em>Overview</em></h4>
Used to determine whether an object is on the server.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-34"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
This is redundant and no longer required because all objects are on the server.
<h4 id="migration-notes-34"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
You can safely remove calls to these APIs from you code. It will always evaluate to true. |

| 
Object |
Method |
setTimeOut |
<h4 id="overview-35"><em>Overview</em></h4>
This method existed on Object, but was non-functional. The implementation on FormRun was used as a timer to delay the execution of a piece of logic.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-35"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
The browser based client no longer supported this implementation.
<h4 id="migration-notes-35"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Use the new setTimeOutEx method on the FormRun instead. Note that the setTimeOutEx method expects the callback to accept a parameter of type AsyncTaskResult, example: myCallBack(AsyncTaskResult result). |

| 
PopupMenu |
Class |
 |
<h4 id="overview-36"><em>Overview</em></h4>
Used in Dynamics AX 2012 to get splitters that let users change the size of the two parts that are split.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-36"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
Relied on APIs that are specific to the Dynamics AX 2012 Windows Client and cannot be used with the client.
<h4 id="migration-notes-36"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Use ContextMenu instead. |

| 
SysExcel |
Class |
 |
<h4 id="overview-37"><em>Overview</em></h4>
The SysExcel classes used COM to create and edit Excel workbooks.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-37"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
SysExcel relied on calls to Excel COM objects from the client. Those COM objects are not on the server and COM calls are highly discouraged going forward.
<h4 id="migration-notes-37"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Use the OpenXML .NET framework APIs instead. We are investigating the creation of an assembly that wraps OpenXML to make it easier to call from X++. |

| 
SysINetMai SysMailer SmmOutlook |
Class |
 |
<h4 id="overview-38"><em>Overview</em></h4>
These email related classes used predominantly client-side technologies that are no longer available and/or are highly discouraged.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-38"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
The SysINetMail class is being deprecated because it used client-side MAPI. The SysMailer class is being deprecated because it used CDO (a variant of OLE messaging). The classes beginning with SmmOutlook are being deprecated since they use Outlook COM objects.
<h4 id="migration-notes-38"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Sending email via SMTP using the SysMailerNet class will be supported going forward. We are also actively working on client-side interactive email capabilities. |

| 
SysFormSplitter |
Class |
 |
<h4 id="overview-39"><em>Overview</em></h4>
Used in Dynamics AX 2012 to get splitters that let users change the size of the two parts that are split.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-39"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
No longer needed in the client.
<h4 id="migration-notes-39"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Controls automatically provide the functionality. You can safely remove any calls to these APIs from your code. A code upgrade rule may be created in the future to automatically remove the usage. |

WinAPIServer |
Method |
cryptProtectData cryptUnprotectData |
<h4 id="overview-43"><em>Overview</em></h4>
The WinAPIServer::cryptProtectData(CryptoBlob _unEncryptedDataBlob) and WinAPIServer::cryptUnProtectData(CryptoBlob _encryptedDataBlob) methods were used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-43"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
These methods are best suited to desktop usage and not recommended for web-based application usage. They also have a negative impact on performance.
<h4 id="migration-notes-43"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Use the .NET framework APIs and well-known hashing/security algorithms instead. |

xApplication |
Method |
runAsync |
<h4 id="overview-44"><em>Overview</em></h4>
In Dynamics AX 2012 the xApplication::runAsync method was used to make asynchronous calls to methods.
<h4 id="reason-for-deprecation-44"><em>Reason for deprecation</em></h4>
Replaced with methods better suited to the client.
<h4 id="migration-notes-44"><em>Migration notes</em></h4>
Use runAsync methods on the Global or FormRun classes instead. These new versions of runAsync enable the caller to make an async call to a static X++ class method. They leverage the .NET System.Threading.Tasks library to execute an async method in X++.  The use of the System.Threading.Tasks.Task type allows the developer to take advantage of the rich set of features available in .NET. |

xGlobal |
Method |
clientKind |
<h4 id="overview-45"><em>Overview</em></h4>
Most commonly used to detect presence of client, such as an interactive session.
