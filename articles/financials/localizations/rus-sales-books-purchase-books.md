## Create a purchase book 

A purchase book is a tax accounting document. In a purchase book, you can record vendor factures, factures on returns and credit notes to vendors, factures on advance reports from advance holders, factures on customer prepayments, and corrected tax transaction factures.

2.  Click the **Statutory reporting** FastTab and, in the **Report Folder** field, specify the folder that contains the purchase book template.
