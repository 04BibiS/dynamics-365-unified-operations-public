## Set up a dimension set for dimensions control for settlements 

Dimension control for settlements helps you accurately manage and analyze accounting with vendors, customers, and advance holders by financial dimension. When you register vendor or customer operations, such as debts and payments, or advance holder operations, such as advance reports and payments, you can specify financial dimensions during settlement. Because you are still specifying dimensions during settlement, you do not generate correct balances for a specific vendor or customer by financial dimension. Dimension control allows you to stop the settlement of invoices and payments that do not have specified dimensions. Dimension control also allows you to verify that the financial dimensions match when you settle vendor, customer, or advanced holder operations.

Use this procedure to set up a dimension set for dimension control for settlements by using the **Financial dimension sets** form.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Financial dimensions** \> **Financial dimension sets**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a dimension set.

3.  Enter the required details.
