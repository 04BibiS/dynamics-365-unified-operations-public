# Set up fixed assets locations and numbering (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Set up a fixed asset location 

You can use the **FA location** page to set up a fixed asset location and specify the company division that the asset belongs to.

Locations are defined for fixed assets to calculate depreciation accrual. Depending on the fixed asset location, the calculated depreciation amount is allocated to the production cost of the product or to a ledger account.

You must define the location of the fixed asset before you acquire the fixed asset. If you are transferring a fixed asset from one location to another, you can create a transfer transaction to register the transfer of the asset..

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Location**.

2.  Click the **New** button to create a fixed asset location.

3.  In the **Location** and **Name** fields, enter a location code and a description for the location.

4.  In the **Separate division ID** field, select a separate division, if the fixed asset is not located at the head office of the company. If you do not specify a separate division, the location of the fixed asset is the head office. **Independent** option is set automatically, if the selected devision is independent one. 

5.  Click the **Fixed asset posting profiles** FastTab.

6.  Click the **New** button to create a line.

7.  In the **Groupings** field, select the grouping for the fixed asset posting profile from one of the following options:
    
      - **Table** – The posting profile is grouped by the selected fixed asset.
    
      - **Group** – The posting profile is grouped by the depreciation group.
    
      - **All** – The posting profile is grouped by all fixed assets.
    
      - **Accounting** – The posting profile is grouped by the value model.

8.  In the **Account relation** field, select the depreciation group, fixed asset, or value model that the posting profile is used for.

9.  In the **Main account** field, select a ledger account to use to post the fixed asset transactions.

11. In the **Account for depr.bonus** field, select a ledger account to use to post the depreciation bonus for the fixed asset, if a depreciation bonus applies.

## Set up a division for a company and associate it with a vendor
Use the Separate divisions page to create a company division, and then associate the division with a vendor. If your company has several divisions, you must associate each division with a vendor.
1. Click **Organization administration** /> **Setup** /> **Separate divisions**.
2. Click the **New** button to create a company division.
3. In the **Separate division ID** field, enter the identification code for the division and in the **Name** field, enter the name of the division.
4. In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account number that is associated with the division.
5. Set the **Independent** option to **Yes** to indicate that the selected division can report the tax declarations independently of the head office.

## Fixed asset numbering  

You have two options for assigning numbers to fixed assets:

  - **Manual selection**: This is appropriate for a company with few fixed assets. No setup is required for manual selection. 
  - **Automatic** numbering of fixed assets based on fixed asset group. This method is appropriate for a company with a large number of fixed assets. You can create many Account/Group numbers for fixed assets, and attach a number series to each group (**Fixed asset (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **FA groups**). You must specify a default number series when you set up fixed assets.
   
### Automatic numbering of all fixed assets from one default number sequence

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Number sequences** \> **Number sequences** and create a new number series for fixed asset numeration by default.

2.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters**. to open the **Fixed Asset Parameters** form.

3.  On the **Number sequences** tab, select a number sequence code for the FA number reference.

4.  On the **Fixed asset** tab set **Autonumeration** option to **Yes**.

When you create a fixed asset on the **Fixed assets** page, the next number in the sequence is automatically entered into the fixed asset number field.


### Automatic numbering of fixed assets based on fixed asset group

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **FA group** .

2.  Select the **Autonumeration FA** check box for the selected FA group, and then select the appropriate number sequence in the **FA autonumbering sequence** field.

This number sequence is used for all fixed assets that are assigned to the fixed asset group.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a fixed asset group, press the **New** button, and then enter the required details.

## Create bar codes from fixed asset numbers 

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Periodic** \> **Create barcodes from FA inventory number**.

2.  Click **Records to include/ Filter** to enter the selection criteria for the fixed asset.

3.  Click **OK** to return to the **Forming barcode from FA number** form.

4.  Click **OK**. If you have not specified a bar code for the fixed asset, the value that you have specified in the **FA number** field will display in the **Bar code** field in the **Fixed assets** form.
