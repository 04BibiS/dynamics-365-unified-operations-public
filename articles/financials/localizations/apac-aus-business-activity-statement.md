# Business activity statement (BAS)

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the business activity statement (BAS) for Australia. The BAS is a form submitted to the Australian Taxation Office by all businesses to report their taxation obligations.          

The business activity statement feature in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations
is designed to help you fill out your Business Activity Statement, commonly known as the BAS. It is very similar to the Calculation Sheet that the Australian Taxation Office provides you when you receive your BAS form in the mail. The taxation liabilities in the BAS include the following:

-   GST amounts you owe the Australian Taxation Office from sales
-   GST amounts the Australian Taxation Office owes you from purchases
-   Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Tax Withheld
-   Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Instalment
-   Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT)

The following list provides an overview of the process to calculate GST and prepare the BAS in General ledger:

1.  [Set up GST prerequisites](apac-aus-business-activity-statement.md#prerequisites) 
2.  [Set up report boxes](tasks/add-bas-report-boxes.md) - You must set up BAS report boxes to report other non-GST tax liabilities and credits for a particular GST settlement periods.
3.  Post and settle Australian BAS to tax authorities for a particular GST settlement period.
4.  Process payments to tax authorities.
5.  Manually adjust journals to transfer non-GST transactions posted to the BAS reconciliation account to the correct ledger account.
6.  [Print and review GST reports](apac-aus-business-activity-statement.md#generate-the-australian-bas).

## GST reporting codes

The BAS report layout is specific about how and where different amounts should be reported, about the fields that are added together and about linking the Sales tax codes to the particular reporting codes. The GST reporting codes refer to a field number on the tax report for the report layout. The codes are linked by associating a GST code to a particular reporting code on the **Report setup** FastTab on the **Sales tax codes** page.

Based on a quarterly BAS format, the following reporting codes must be set up. These reporting codes are associated with the field that appears on the BAS report. You can set up the reporting codes on the **Sales tax reporting codes** page (**Tax > Setup > Sales tax > Sales tax reporting codes**).

| Report Layout | Reporting Code | Report Text                                                                | Field in BAS report |
