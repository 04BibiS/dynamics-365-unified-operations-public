# Fiscal service (ESR) integration

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In Austria, all cash payments should be signed by an external device or service and securely stored. In Czech Republic, all cash payments should be sent to the government portal for a fiscal signature. In both countries, a cash receipt should be issued where the signature is printed.

To support these requirements for these two countries, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition allows you to integrate with a fiscal service that is compliant with specific requirements for cash payment control in different countries. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's assumed that all other specific country legal requirements concerning the registered transactions are fulfilled on the side of fiscal service and it is the user's responsibility to properly set up and administer the third-party fiscal service.

## Setup

### Cash registers 
Each cash register must be set up to communicate with the fiscal service. You can set up cash registers on the **Cash registers** page (**Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash registers**). Refer to the following table for more information.

<table> 
<tr>
	<td><strong>Setup</strong></td>
<td><strong>Details</strong></td>

</tr>
</table>

### Cash register locations
You can set up locations of cash registers on the **Cash register locations** page (**Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash register locations**). 

#### Czech Republic prerequisites
Before you set up cash register locations for a legal entity with a primary address in the Czech Republic, you must do the following:

1. Create a tax registration type for Business Premises ID (**Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Registration types** > **Registration types**). 
	1. This registration type should be restricted to **Organization**.
2. Associate the registration type that you created in step one with the registration category **Business Premise ID**.
	1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Registration types** > **Registration categories**. 
	2. Select the registration type that you created earlier, and then select **Business Premise ID** for the **Registration category**.
3. Associate the Business Premises ID number with the operating unit address for the operating unit that you will use for the cash register loation. 
	1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Common** > **Organizations** > **Internal organizations**.
	2. Select the organization to associate with the Business Premise ID number.
	3. Expand the **Addresses** FastTab and click **More options** > **Advanced**. 
	4. On the **Registration Id** FastTab, click **Add**. 
	5. Select the registration type that you created in step one earlier.
	6. Enter the registration number.

### Create cash register terminals
Create cash register terminals on the **Cash register terminals** page (**Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash register terminals**).

### Assign the user to a person
Assign a User who is acting as cash operator and is allowed to log a cash transaction which will be registered in cash register, to a Person in **System administration** > **Users**. 

### Set up cash register operators
Set up cash register operators and assign them to the cash register location in **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash register** > **Cash register operators**. 

### Set up methods of payment that require fiscal registration
Set up methods of payment, which needs to be registered in cash register at **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash register methods of payment**. 

|Field |Description |
|--|-------|
|Method of payment|Choose a method of payment which needs to be registered in cash register and sent to Fiscal service.|
|Register tax amount|Activate the check box if the tax amounts related to the cash payment amount need to be registered in Fiscal service.|

#### Important notices
In the following scenarios, the tax amounts related to the payment amount can be identified reliably from the posted transactions:
- For the cash payment posted automatically during posting of a COD invoice (cash on delivery terms of payment), tax amounts sent are equal to the tax amounts produced by an invoice posting.
- For the cash prepayment posted manually from the customer payment journal, when sales tax amounts are calculated and posted from the payment journal (tax amounts posted from the prepayment are always sent irrespectively from the parameter Register tax amount).
User should consult with local tax authority to identify the requirements to registering the tax amounts related to the cash payment in the cash register. User should split methods of payment if necessary.

In the following scenarios, the tax amounts related to payment amount can't be identified reliably from the posted transactions:
- For the cash payment posted manually from the customer payment journal and settled to the previously posted invoice which contains a posted tax amount.
- If you set up to send these tax amounts to cash register, they can't be considered as fully correct tax amounts but rather rough tax amounts are calculated from the payment amount by a specific amount distribution logic. 

In these scenarios, the correct tax amounts are presented only in the settled posted invoice. Consult with local tax authority to identify the right way for submitting the invoiced tax amounts to tax authority checks for these scenarios.

### Create terms of payment for cash on delivery scenario
Create Terms of payment with Cash on delivery payment method if a cash payment can be received in the moment of an invoice posting, at **Account receivables** > **Payment** > **Terms of payment**.

|Field |Description |
|--|-------|
|Payment method |Choose "COD".|
|Cash payment| Enable the parameter to create an automatic payment transaction.|
|Cash| Choose G/L account for posting of an automatically generated cash payment.| 

## Example
This section walks you through the following business processes using the [EFR](http://public.efsta.net/efr/) fiscal service provided by EFSTA(European Fiscal Standards Association) as an example.

- PostingAfter you post a cash payment that is liable for registration, a cash register transaction with data to be signed is created and sent for theÂ registrationÂ to fiscal service in the specified XML format. 
- Response with a signature and fiscal codes (generated by Fiscal service per country-specific rules) is received from the fiscal service and stored in theÂ Cash register fiscalÂ transaction.
- The cash receipt with transaction data and signatures/fiscal codes is printed.

### Register automatically posted COD payment for the Free text invoice and print cash receipt
1. Go to **Accounts receivable** > **Free text invoices** > **All free text invoices**.
2. Create a free text invoice. For more information, see [Create a free text invoice](../accounts-receivable/tasks/create-free-text-invoice.md).

	1. Activate the check-box **Print receipt** in the fast tab **Parameters** for printing the cash receipt after the invoice is posted.
	2. On fast tab **Cash register** review the location, terminal, cash register and operator code. The terminal code is pre-filled from the **Default cash register terminal**Â field in the **Cash register operators** page. Change the Terminal code only if the cash payment is received in a different cash register terminal available for the current operator.
	3. Click **OK**.
7. Review the generated cash receipt for the posted invoice. By default, the generated cash receipt is available as a file. For information about how to set up other destinations that you could use for cash receipt output, see [Electronic Reporting Destinations](../../dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations.md).


### Register automatically posted COD payment for the Sales order invoice and print cash receipt
1. Go to **Accounts receivable** > **Orders** > **All sales orders**.
2. Create a sales order. For more information, see [Create a sales order](../../supply-chain/sales-marketing/tasks/create-sales-orders.md)

If cash payment wasn't successfully registered for any infrastructural reason (not related with exception scenarios described in the law which should be correctly handled on Fiscal service side), a user will get respective an error message after a posting of cash payment. The cash register transaction in status "Created"Â will be available in theÂ Cash register fiscal transactions form. User must fix infrastructural issues and manually resend the created cash transactions to the cash register. Otherwise, user is not able to print the cash receipt with fiscal codes. Correctly, the registered transaction gets status "Registered".
