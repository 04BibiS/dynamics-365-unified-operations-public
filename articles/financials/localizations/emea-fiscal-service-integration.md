# Fiscal service (ESR) integration

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In Austria, all cash payments should be signed by an external device or service and securely stored. In Czech Republic, all cash payments should be sent to the government portal for a fiscal signature. In both countries, a cash receipt should be issued where the signature is printed.

To support these requirements for these two countries, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition allows you to integrate with a fiscal service that is compliant with specific requirements for cash payment control in different countries. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's assumed that all other specific country legal requirements concerning the registered transactions are fulfilled on the side of fiscal service and it is the user's responsibility to properly set up and administer the third-party fiscal service.

## Available configurations
The format of Cash receipt, XML request to Fiscal service and XML response from Fiscal service are configured as Electronic reporting configurations. The following configurations are available:

## Setup

### Cash registers 
Each cash register must be set up to communicate with the fiscal service. You can set up cash registers on the **Cash registers** page (**Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash registers**). Refer to the following table for more information.

<table> 
<tr>
	<td><strong>Setup</strong></td>
<td><strong>Details</strong></td>
<td><strong>More information</strong></td></tr>

	<td>Enter the <strong>Cash register URL</strong>, the <strong>Key Vault name</strong> and the <strong>Class name</strong>.</td>
	<td><p><strong>Cash register URL</strong> - Enter the URL for the Fiscal service. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Third party services or other services that you configure here do not require a certification and they might not meet Microsoft privacy standards. You should review each service's privacy documentation and work with each service provider to learn more about each service's provided level of compliance. You are responsible for ensuring that these services meet your security, privacy and legal standards. You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. It is strongly recommended that you use only services that provide secure and authorized connections (https://).</p>
		<p><strong>Key Vault name</strong> - If the fiscal service is accessible at a secure connection (https://), you should set up certificates and store them properly on both sides â€“ Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition and the third party fiscal service. Choose the name of the Key Vault where the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition certificate is stored.

### Cash register locations
You can set up locations of cash registers on the **Cash register locations** page (**Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash register locations**). 

#### Czech Republic prerequisites
Before you set up cash register locations for a legal entity with a primary address in the Czech Republic, you must do the following:

1. Create a tax registration type for Business Premises ID (**Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Registration types** > **Registration types**). 
	1. This registration type should be restricted to **Organization**.
2. Associate the registration type that you created in step one with the registration category **Business Premise ID**.
	1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Registration types** > **Registration categories**. 
	2. Select the registration type that you created earlier, and then select **Business Premise ID** for the **Registration category**.
3. Associate the Business Premises ID number with the operating unit address for the operating unit that you will use for the cash register loation. 
	1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Common** > **Organizations** > **Internal organizations**.
	2. Select the organization to associate with the Business Premise ID number.
	3. Expand the **Addresses** FastTab and click **More options** > **Advanced**. 
	4. On the **Registration Id** FastTab, click **Add**. 
	5. Select the registration type that you created in step one earlier.
	6. Enter the registration number.

### Create cash register terminals
Create cash register terminals which are available for the location and assign the cash register for the terminal on the **Cash register terminals** page (**Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash register terminals**).

### Assign the user to a person
Assign a User who is acting as cash operator and is allowed to log a cash transaction which will be registered in cash register, to a Person in **System administration** > **Users**. 

### Set up cash register operators
Set up cash register operators, assign them to the cash register location and assign default terminal in **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash register** > **Cash register operators**. 

### Set up methods of payment that require fiscal registration
Set up methods of payment, which needs to be registered in cash register at **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Cash registers** > **Cash register methods of payment**. 

|Field |Description |
|--|-------|
|Method of payment|Choose a method of payment which needs to be registered in cash register and sent to Fiscal service.|
|Register tax amount|Activate the check box if the tax amounts related to the cash payment amount need to be registered in Fiscal service.|

#### Important notices
In the following scenarios, the tax amounts related to the payment amount can be identified reliably from the posted transactions:
- For the cash payment posted automatically during posting of a COD invoice (cash on delivery terms of payment), tax amounts sent are equal to the tax amounts produced by an invoice posting.
- For the cash prepayment posted manually from the customer payment journal, when sales tax amounts are calculated and posted from the payment journal (tax amounts posted from the prepayment are always sent irrespectively from the parameter Register tax amount).
User should consult with local tax authority to identify the requirements to registering the tax amounts related to the cash payment in the cash register. User should split methods of payment if necessary.

In the following scenarios, the tax amounts related to payment amount can't be identified reliably from the posted transactions:
- For the cash payment posted manually from the customer payment journal and settled to the previously posted invoice which contains a posted tax amount.
- If you set up to send these tax amounts to cash register, they can't be considered as fully correct tax amounts but rather rough tax amounts are calculated from the payment amount by a specific amount distribution logic. 

In these scenarios, the correct tax amounts are presented only in the settled posted invoice. Consult with local tax authority to identify the right way for submitting the invoiced tax amounts to tax authority checks for these scenarios.

### Create terms of payment for cash on delivery scenario
Create Terms of payment with Cash on delivery payment method if a cash payment can be received in the moment of an invoice posting, at **Account receivables** > **Payment** > **Terms of payment**.

|Field |Description |
|--|-------|
|Payment method |Choose "COD".|
|Cash payment| Enable the parameter to create an automatic payment transaction.|
|Cash| Choose G/L account for posting of an automatically generated cash payment.| 

## Example
This section walks you through the following business processes using the [EFR](http://public.efsta.net/efr/) fiscal service provided by EFSTA(European Fiscal Standards Association) as an example.

- After you post a cash payment that is liable for registration, a cash register transaction with data to be signed is created and sent for theÂ registrationÂ to fiscal service in the specified XML format. 
- Response with a signature and fiscal codes (generated by Fiscal service per country-specific rules) is received from the fiscal service and stored in theÂ Cash register fiscalÂ transaction.
- The cash receipt with transaction data and signatures/fiscal codes is printed.
