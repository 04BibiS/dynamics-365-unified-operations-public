Purchase order might be used if several identical fixed assets are bought or it is necessary to track inventory movement of fixed asset.

## Reverse a fixed asset acquisition transaction    
    
When you create a reverse transaction, the information and amount of the original transaction are saved. By default, the reversal date and the original transaction date are the same. However, when reversing transactions, you can specify a reversal date that is different from the original transaction date. You can also reverse an amortization transaction using this process. 

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets**. click **Value Models**\> **Transactions** to open the **FA Transactions** form.

2.  Select the fixed asset acquisition transaction, and then click **Reverse transaction** to open the **Reverse transaction** form.

3.  In the **Reverse date**, select the transaction reverse date.

4.  Click **OK**. A transaction is created in the **FA transactions** form that reverses the original transaction.

5.  Click **Voucher** to view the transaction in the ledger in the **Voucher transactions** page.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > To change the status to **Scheduled**, run the reverse acquisition transaction for all value models. If the asset that was reversed was built from inventory components, transactions are created to record the return of the components to the inventory. When you reverse an acquisition transaction, the cost price of the returned components may differ from the current warehouse cost price. However, after inventory closure, the components will reflect the current pricing.
