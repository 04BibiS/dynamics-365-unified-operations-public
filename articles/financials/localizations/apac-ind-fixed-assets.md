Fixed assets are items of value, such as buildings, vehicles, land, and
equipment, which are owned by an individual or corporation. You can set up and
enter acquisition information for fixed asset records, and then manage fixed
assets by depreciating them and setting a capitalization threshold to determine
depreciation. You can calculate adjustments to the fixed assets, and also
dispose of them.
