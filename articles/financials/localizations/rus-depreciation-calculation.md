## Calculate or reverse depreciation using the tax group non-linear depreciation method 

You can calculate depreciation in tax accounting by using the linear method or the non-linear method. You can also calculate tax depreciation by using the tax non-linear group depreciation method. This method allows you to specify a depreciation rate for each group, or a depreciation factor for each subgroup, to calculate the depreciation amount that is accrued for each depreciation group or subgroup.

You can group the depreciation register lines by depreciation group or subgroup by using the **FA depreciation (nonlinear method)**, **IA depreciation (nonlinear method)**, **FA - information about object**, and **IA - object information** tax registers.

Use the following procedures to set up a method of depreciation, and to calculate or reverse depreciation by using the tax group non-linear depreciation method.

## Calculating depreciation bonus

The depreciation bonus is an additional depreciation amount that is assessed during the first year for some operational asset types. You must set up a posting profile and create an acquisition journal before you calculate the fixed asset depreciation bonus.

Use the **Depreciation bonus** page to calculate the depreciation bonus for fixed assets by using the **Tax nonlinear group method** as the depreciation method. When you create the depreciation transactions, a depreciated bonus is calculated for every asset. The bonus amount is calculated first, and then the depreciation from the cost is calculated, excluding the bonus. The bonus amount is not included in the total balance of the depreciation group. For more information, see [Depreciation bonus (Russia)[rus-bonus-depreciation.md].
