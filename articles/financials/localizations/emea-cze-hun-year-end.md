[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the year end closing process and opening transactions for Hungary and Czech Republic. This functionality allows user to set up the year end closing process in the following way:
- Posting to different accounts for Closing and Opening of balance accounts
- Transfer of Profit or Loss year end result into the newly opened year to a different account

## Year end closing setup
On the **Accounts for automatic transactions**  page, you can specify the general ledger accounts to be used during the year end closing process:

-   Year-end result – this account will be used for transferring the ending balances of profit and loss transactions
-   Transfer of closing and opening transactions – this account will be used for transferring ending balances of balance sheet accounts

## Opening transactions setup
Before you can post opening transactions to a different account for each of the accounts that you set up earlier, you must specify another general ledger account in the Opening account field on the main account.
