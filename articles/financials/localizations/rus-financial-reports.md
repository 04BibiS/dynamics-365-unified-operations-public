# Financial reports (Russia)

The Financial reports setup interface allows you to configure content of “boxed” reports like
Balance sheet. For each report box or cell, the data collection for ledger
transactions, budget transactions, and calculated profit tax registers can be
configured. 

You should also configure report output in GER (electronic reporting) in a way where ER
configuration takes the data calculated according to user setup of the
financial report and generates the file output according to format
configuration (for example Excel and/or XML).


You should also configure Electronic message processing where one of the steps allows authorized user to
run the ER configuration of the financial report, generate report and store generated
report data.
