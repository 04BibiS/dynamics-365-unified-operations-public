You can enable the reverse charge functionality by setting the **Reverse charge** option to **Yes** on the **General ledger parameters** page.

### Create sales tax codes for reverse charge operations

It is necessary to set up two sales tax codes for reverse charge operations (for purchase operations): one with positive rate and another with negative rate.  You may fill in negative rate (SALES TAX CODE/ Value button) if Negative sales tax percentage check box has been selected in the Sales tax codes form (see the screenshot below).

### Create a sales tax group for reverse charge
Create a sales tax group that has the **Reverse charge** check box selected for a sales tax code with a negative rate. The two sales tax codes that you created in [Create sales tax codes for reverse charge operations](#create-sales-tax-codes-for-reverse-charge-operations) should be added to a sales tax group and to an item sales tax group.  See how sales tax functionality works in Sales tax codes, Sales tax group and Item sales tax groups
Tax > Indirect taxes > Sales tax > Sales tax groups

## Invoice language

If the user language is different than the legal entity
The system output invoice in two languages if the customer language is different from the language which set up in Legal entity form otherwise the invoice will output only in the language, which set up in Legal entity form. If the system determines that an invoice should be output in two languages (for example, English and Arabic) itâ€™ll output two printing invoices:  one output report in English and another in Arabic. 

## Example: Sales tax payment by report code

The diagram below shows how data may be collected in Sales tax payment by report code report. 
It is important to note that data is collected on the base of sales tax transactions. Therefore, if an invoice created has not tax transactions then this invoice will not be included in the report.  One report code may be selected in several sales tax codes and several report codes may be selected in one sales tax code in different fields.
