## Setting up sales tax for Saudi Arabia

### Sales tax reporting codes example for Saudi Arabia
You can create report codes which might be necessary for analysis (E.g. details of legislation return and/or data disclosure). The following screenshot shows examples of reporting codes.

![Sales tax reporting codes example](media/apac-sau-sales-tax-reporting-codes.png)

### Sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups

For Saudi Arabia, the following Tax type with values added for VAT type: Standard VAT, Reduced VAT, VAT 0%
New value in Country/ Region field: GCC
Translation of sales tax description (button Tax directive)

 


Sales tax group may be set up in Customer/ Vendor by default and Item sales tax group may be set up in Items by default when a user creates sales/purchase order the system transfers Sales tax group from customer to the header and lines and transfers Item sales tax group from item to the lines. But a user may change groups both in the header and in lines.

If a sales tax code is included in two groups (sales tax group and item sales tax group) in the line, then when posting the invoice, the system will create sales tax transaction with this sales tax code and calculate sales tax. If there is no intersection of sales tax codes in groups of line, then sales tax transaction will not be created

The following diagram demonstrates one way that sales tax groups can be set up and how sales tax transactions and sales tax calculation are defined given that setup.  

![Sales tax groups diagram](media/apac-sau-sales-tax-groups-diagram.png)

For each sales tax code enter the following: 
- Type of tax (Standard VAT or VAT 0%)
- Settlement period
 > [!NOTE]
 > When you select a settlement period the system automatically fills in the **Report layout** field.
- Ledger posting codes
- Calculation (firstly the settings by default may be used)
- Report setup/ Report setup â€“ Credit note

Your company's accounting practices will affect how you set up Sales tax groups and Item sales tax groups to include sales tax codes. 
For example, an export operation might select the **Exempt** check box and Select **Exempt code**. In this case, the system will create sales tax transaction with VAT equal to zero. But with the rate equal to 5% (Value field in sales tax transaction). It may be useful for analysis of export operations by VAT rates.   

For import operations from third countries (VAT is paid at customs) you might use the following setting: 

When you post an invoice with such setting, the system creates sales tax transaction with Use tax direction, but sales tax is not included in vendor liability. Sales transactions with Use tax direction are not taken into account when settling and posting sales taxes (see Settle and post sales tax), and depending on ledger posting setting (see Ledger posting groups) the system creates ledger transactions for this sales tax (see the screenshot below).
This setting allows you to analyze purchases from third countries by VAT rates.
Example of sales tax transactions with different values of sales tax direction.

## Reverse charges

### Enable reverse charge
You can enable the reverse charge functionality by setting the **Reverse charge** option to **Yes** on the **General ledger parameters** page. This functionality, when enabled, requires that the buyer reports the VAT transaction on behalf of the seller.  

### Create sales tax codes for reverse charge operations
Create sales tax codes for reverse charge operations (for purchase operations). It is necessary to set up two sales tax codes for reverse charge operations (for purchase operations): one with a positive rate and another with a negative rate.  You can fill in negative rate (SALES TAX CODE/ Value button) if Negative sales tax percentage check box has been selected in the Sales tax codes page as shown in the following screenshot.
![Sales tax codes for reverse charge](media/apac-sau-sales-tax-codes-reverse-charge.png)

### Create a sales tax group for reverse charge
Create a sales tax group that has the **Reverse charge** check box selected for a sales tax code with a negative rate. The two sales tax codes that you created in [Create sales tax codes for reverse charge operations](#create-sales-tax-codes-for-reverse-charge-operations) should be added to a sales tax group and to an item sales tax group.  

![Reverse charge selection on sales tax group](media/apac-sau-sales-tax-group-reverse-charge.png)


### Sales tax transactions with reverse charges
If the **Reverse charge** check box is selected in the sales tax group, sales tax transactions are created when you post an invoice. One transaction includes sales tax receivable and another transaction includes a sales tax payable direction. 

Tax > Inquiries and reports > Sales tax inquiries > Posted sales tax

## Printing invoices

When you print an invoice, if your language is different than the language specified for the current legal entity, two invoices will be generated, one in Arabic and the other in the language that you selected on the **User options** page.

## Sales tax payment by code report

The following diagram shows how data may be collected in the **Sales tax payment by code** report. If an invoice does not include tax transactions then the invoice will not be included in the **Sales tax payment by code** report.  One report code may be selected in several sales tax codes and several report codes may be selected in one sales tax code in different fields.
