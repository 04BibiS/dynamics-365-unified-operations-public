# Report 340

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Report 340 is a report that replaced two reports (Sales and Purchases Statutory Books) that all Spanish companies submited as hard copy to the Spanish tax authorities. 
The new report may be uploaded to the tax authority Web site or submitted using a software package that is available free of cost from the tax authority. Report 340 contains information of all invoices and taxes pertaining to invoices that were issued or received by a company during a specific period. Report 340 should be submitted to the tax authorities during the first 20 days following the reporting period (month or quarter, depending on the size of the company). 

## Entries included in Report 340
Report 340 includes the following entries: 
- Sales entries: Entries of VAT report lines corresponding to sales invoices and project invoices. These records are **Type 2** issued invoices.
- Sales credit memos (corrective invoices): Entries of VAT report lines corresponding to corrective invoices. 
- Purchase entries: Entries of VAT report lines corresponding to purchase invoices. These records are **Type 2** received invoices.
- Purchase credit memos: Entries of VAT report lines corresponding to corrective invoices. 
- Auto-invoices and auto-credit memos: Entries of VAT report lines corresponding to auto-invoices and auto-credit memos, which are created when goods or services are delivered by a vendor in the European Union.
- Invoices that include equivalence charge. Equivalence charge is a Spanish sales tax type.
- Invoices including different VAT% or equivalence charge percentage (EC%) – Entries of invoices that have more than one VAT% or EC%.
