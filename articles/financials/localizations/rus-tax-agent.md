# Overview of VAT for tax agents

When a company is acknowledged as a tax agent it has to accrue and to deduct VAT correctly from funds, paid to taxpayers (or to accrue at the expense of own funds), and to transfer VAT to the tax authority. 
This functionality is required to support generation of invoices, factures, and payments to vendors for whom our company is defined as tax (fiscal) agents.
The following functions are supported: 
 - Creating vendors with whom we operate as tax agent.
 - Marking sales tax codes for tax agent transactions to determine if the VAT payments are to be made from the vendor's funds or at the expense of the company's own funds.
 - Creating payment proposals for  vendors' invoices.
 - Creating payments for tax authorities
 - Posting and settlement of payments to the vendor.
 - Creating and printing factures for VAT amount, being liable to the budget, and registering the factures in the sales book
 - Creating and printing factures for VAT deductions and registering the factures in the purchase book.
