## Set up a foreign bank 


When you make payments to the foreign bank account of a vendor, the vendor must register the bank account with a Russian bank. Otherwise, the vendor cannot receive the payments. You can use the **Banks** form to set up a foreign bank. You can then link the foreign bank to the vendor account that is associated with it.

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Setup** \> **Bank groups**.

2.  Create a foreign bank.

3.  In the **Bank type** field, select **Foreign**.

4.  Click the **General** FastTab.

5.  In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account to associate with the foreign bank.


## Changes to company bank accounts 


The status of the bank account for an organization determines the account reconciliation, transaction posting, and statement generation processes. The status of a bank account can be inactive either for all transactions or only for new transactions that are created after the account is inactivated. If the status of the bank account is inactive for all transactions, you cannot post any outgoing or incoming payments and payment receipt transactions. You cannot generate incoming or outgoing transaction statements for inactive bank accounts. If the status is inactive for new transactions, you cannot post incoming payments, but you can post outgoing payments for transactions that were posted when the account was active.

You cannot change the bank account status to inactive if the account has any vendor transactions that are open. You also cannot use the **Transit account** function to change the date of a posted transaction when you reconcile a bank account that is inactive.


## Create a document type code to export or import payments 

Use the **Document type** form to create a code for a document type that you can use to export or import payments. The document type is used to identify the payment files when you export or import payments. Document type codes are used to identify incoming and outgoing payments. These payments are posted to bank accounts for the selected payment document types. A unique two-digit code is assigned to every type of document. For example, 01 can be used for payment orders, and 09 can be used for memorial slips.

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Setup** \> **Payment order** \> **Kinds of documents**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new document type code.

3.  In the **The code of document kind** field, enter a two-digit document code. For example, enter 01 for payment orders.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter the name of the document.

5.  In the **Document type** field, select the type of document:
    
      - **Pay document** – Create a payment order, which includes a payment transaction for import or export to the client bank.
    
      - **Memorial order** – Create a memorial slip. A memorial slip is a primary document that the bank uses to transfer money from a cash account to a bank account, or from a bank account to a cash account.
    
      - **Currency transfer** – Create a currency transfer order.
    
      - **Currency sale** – Create a currency sale when you sell foreign currency for business transactions.
    
      - **Currency purchase** – Create a currency purchase transaction when you transfer foreign currency for business transactions.
