# Set up parameters for SPED fiscal text files 

The Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal text files contain information about all fiscal documents that have been received and issued in a month for a specific fiscal establishment. The SPED system is used by federal tax authorities to verify Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) and Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) tax calculations. Before you can generate a SPED fiscal text file to submit to the federal tax authorities, you must specify parameters that define how the SPED fiscal text file will be saved. This topic explains how to specify these parameters by using the **SPED fiscal parameters** form. 


> [!NOTE]
> The procedure for completing this task has changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. For information that is specific to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, see the section later in this topic.



## Set up requirements for SPED fiscal text files

1.  Click **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Tax statements parameters**. Select **SPED Fiscal**, on the **Setup parameters** FastTab, click **Open**.

2.  In the **SPED fiscal parameters** form, select the location where the SPED fiscal text file will be saved.

3.  Select a profile presentation. For the current release, only the **A** profile presentation is supported.

4.  Select the current available version of the SPED fiscal text file format to generate.
    
5.  Select the type of activity to include in the SPED fiscal text file. The following options are available:
    
      - **Industrial or equivalent** – Select this option to include information for activities related to industries, for example manufacturing of goods.
    
      - **Others** – Select this option for all other types of activities.
      
6. Enable the generation of Block K . When disabled, only records K001 and K999 are generated

# Generate the SPED fiscal export file for a month 

The Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal text file provides information about fiscal documents that were received and issued during a specific month. This information is used by tax authorities. The SPED fiscal text file also includes information about tax assessments and payments during the month. This topic explains how to generate a SPED fiscal text file by using the **Booking period** list page.

2.  Select a booking period, and then click **SPED Fiscal**.

3.  Specify the location and name of the file. The default location is specified in the **SPED fiscal parameters** form, and the default file name is automatically generated. In most cases, you should accept the default entry.
