# Fixed assets depreciation for Russia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


## Set up depreciation methods

Depreciation methods are used to define the rules for calculating depreciation. Use this procedure to set up depreciation methods.

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation methods**.
2.  Press the New button to create a new depreciation method.
3.  In the **Depreciation method** field, enter the identification code of the depreciation method for the fixed asset and in the **Name** field, enter the name of the depreciation method.
4.  In the **Method** field, select the depreciation method from the following options:
      - **[Linear](rus-depreciation-methods.md#linear-and-non-linear-depreciation-methods)** − This method is a uniform accrual method. A capital allowance is calculated proportionately for each period or interval that you set up, such as monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, or for the whole service life of the asset.
       - **Reducing remainder** − This method decreases the depreciation value over the service life of the asset. The depreciation amount is based on the residual value of the fixed asset at the start of the reporting year. The depreciation rate is calculated based on the remaining useful life and the acceleration factor.
       - **[Manual](rus-depreciation-methods.md#manual-depreciation-method)** − The depreciation schedule is defined as a percentage value for each period. In this method, you can manually define the depreciation rate for each depreciation period.
       - **[Factor](rus-depreciation-methods.md#factor-depreciation-method)** − The depreciation amount is calculated as a remaining amount that is multiplied by a fixed ratio.
       - **By number of years** − The asset value is based on the number of years of useful life that remain.
       - **[Product output/mileage](rus-depreciation-methods.md#product-output-mileage-depreciation-method)** − The asset value is proportionate to the volume of units that are produced.
       - **Tax nonlinear** − The accrued monthly depreciation for the asset is defined as the product of its remaining value and the depreciation rate. The depreciation rate is defined as K= (2/n) \* 100%, where n is the useful life of the asset in months.
       - **[Tax nonlinear group method](rus-depreciation-methods.md#non-linear-tax-accounting-group-depreciation-method)** − The accrued monthly depreciation for the asset group is defined as the product of its remaining value and the depreciation rate. The depreciation rate is defined as K = (2/n) \* 100%, where n is the useful life of the asset group in months.
5.  In the **Interval** field, select the period for which the depreciation must be accrued. If you select **Quarterly** in the **Interval** field, you must enter three monthly transactions instead of a single transaction for the whole quarter.
6.  In the **Factor** field, enter the factor or percentage that must be reduced by interval.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is available only if you select <STRONG>Reducing remainder</STRONG> or <STRONG>Factor</STRONG> as the depreciating method.</P>
    
7.  In the **Cost limit** field for the **Tax nonlinear** method, enter the cutoff percentage value. When the accrued depreciation amount is calculated, the depreciation amount for the year is recalculated based on the service life and the depreciation profile for the asset. The amount is allocated across the specified periods in the year.
8.  Click **Schedule of depreciation** to manually create depreciation schedules for fixed assets.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Schedule of depreciation</STRONG> button is available only if you select <STRONG>Manual</STRONG> as the depreciation method.</P>

### Change the depreciation method in tax accounting 

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Periodic** \> **Changing depreciation method**.
2.  On the **General** tab, in the **Year** field, select the year when the new depreciation method will go into effect.
3.  In the **Old depreciation profile** field, select the depreciation method that was previously used for tax accounting.
4.  In the **New depreciation profile** field, select the new depreciation method to be used.
5.  Click **Record to include/ Filter** to open the **Inquiry** form, and then enter the selection criteria for fixed assets.
6.  Click **OK**. The new depreciation method will be updated in the **Depreciation method** field on the **General** tab in the **FA value models** form.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Click **Fixed assets (Russia)> Common > Fixed assets**.Click **Fixed assets > Value models > FA lifetime history** to open the **FA history** page to view these changes.
    
## Set up analysis codes for fixed asset depreciation 
Analysis codes are used to calculate the depreciation accrual for a fixed asset. You can set up an annual depreciation rate that is applied to the fixed assets or to a depreciation group. 

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Analysis codes**.
2.  On the left pane, press CTRL+N to create a new line.
3.  In the **Analysis code** field, enter the analysis code and in the **Name** field, enter a description of the analysis code.
4.  In the **Depreciation group** field, select a depreciation group.
5.  In the **Depreciation type** field, select the depreciation type from the following options:
      - **On cost** − The analysis code is applied to all fixed assets excluding vehicular fixed assets.
      - **On 1000 km mileage** − The analysis code is applied to vehicular fixed assets.
6.  On the right pane, press the Add button to create a new line.
7.  In the **Start date** field, specify the date when the depreciation rate becomes active.
8.  In the **Depreciation rate** field, enter the annual depreciation rate as a percentage.
9. In the **Factor** field, enter the factor by which the specified depreciation rate is increased or decreased from the fixed value that is defined by the Russian Federation legislation for a fixed asset group.

## Set up depreciation groups 

Depreciation groups are defined for fixed asset value models to specify asset details such as the depreciation profile, service life, and deferral parameters that are generated when depreciating a fixed asset. 

If a fixed asset is registered after putting into operation, depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month of registration. If a fixed asset is registered before it is put into operation, depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month after the fixed asset is put into operation. 

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation groups**.
2.  In the **Value model** field, select the value model that the depreciation group is defined for.
3.  Create a line.
4.  In the **Depreciation group** and **Name** fields, enter the depreciation group code and name for the depreciation group.
5.  In the **Depreciation method** field, select a depreciation method for the depreciation group.
6.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Lifetime** field, enter the maximum service life, in years, during which depreciation is accrued for the fixed assets in the depreciation group.
7.  In the **Minimal depreciation** field, enter the minimum depreciation amount when you use the **Reducing remainder** depreciation method.
8.  In the **Depreciation start date** field, select the type of starting date for depreciation from the following options:    
      - **From month when put into operation** – Depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month when the fixed asset is put to use after acquisition.
      - **Next month start** – Depreciation is calculated from the month after the fixed asset is put to use after acquisition.
      - **Next quarter start** – Depreciation is calculated from the quarter after the fixed asset is put to use after acquisition.
      - **Next half year start** – Depreciation is calculated from the half-year after the fixed asset is put to use after acquisition.
      - **Next year start** – Depreciation is calculated from the year after the fixed asset is put to use after acquisition.
9.  Click the **Deferrals** FastTab.
10. In the left pane, click **Disposal** to set up parameters to create deferrals on the disposal of fixed assets that accrue a loss. Click **Partial dismantlement** to create deferrals on the partial write-off of fixed assets that accrue a loss.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create a transaction for the partial write-off or disposal of a fixed asset, if the transaction causes a loss, the transaction details are posted to a deferral account. This account contains the values of the calculated loss and the write-off time. The write-off time is calculated by using the fixed asset depreciation factor and the difference between the useful life of the depreciated asset and the actual period that the asset is used before disposal.

11. In the right pane, press CTRL+N to create a line.
12. In the **Model number** field, select the model number of the deferral.
13. In the **Deferrals group** field, select the deferrals group for deferred expenses.
14. In the **Expense code** field, select the expense code for deferrals.
