# Post and print a packing slip with transportation delivery details for Italy

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you ship goods to customers, the shipment must contain a transportation delivery document (TDD). The TDD provides information about the customer, contractor, owner, and loader involved in the shipment. To print a packing slip with transportation delivery details, you must first set up transportation delivery details. 

## Set up transportation delivery details

To print the transportation document and shipping information on a packing slip, you must set up the transportation delivery details in the Accounts receivable parameters and Form setup pages.

1. Go to the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. 
2. Click **Shipments**, and then in the **Carrier name** field, select the name of the carrier for the customer shipment. 
3. Set the option **Use transportation document information on packing slip** to Yes to display the transportation details on the packing slip when it is posted. 
4. Close the page to save your changes. 
5. Click **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Forms** > **Form setup**. 
6. Click the **Packing slip** link, and then select the **Shipping details** check box to print shipping information, including the carrier details, on the packing slip. 
7. Select the **Transportation document** check box to print the transportation document details on the packing slip. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This check box is available only if the **Use transportation document information on packing slip** option is set to **Yes** on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. 
8. Close the page to save your changes.
