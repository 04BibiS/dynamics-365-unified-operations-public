# Personal information requests for Estonia

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Estonia legally allows people to ask companies for reports that identify what personal information they track and who has viewed, created, updated and deleted this information.

All companies have to gather data of employees, customers, vendors and other personal data. When the data is gathered about persons, most of the information is considered as personal data and must be handled correctly according to the Estonian legislation. All information coming from logging changes or inquiries on those tables are presented in three defined reports: Personal chart, Access log and Permission changes reports.


## Reports available

- **Access log** - Generate a report that displays the fields and tables that are related to an employee’s personal information, and that have been accessed within a specified time frame. (**Human resources** > **Reports** > **Personal data** > **Access log**)
- **Permission changes log** - Generate and print a report that displays changes to an employee’s permissions to access information, security rights, or user role. You can select to view the permission changes as an overall list for the employee, or as a breakdown of tables and fields. (**Human resources** > **Reports** > **Personal data** > **Permission changes log**)
- **Personal chart** - Generate a report that displays a selected employee’s personal information. (**Human resources** > **Reports** > **Personal data** > **Pesonal chart**)
