This topic explains how to set up, create and export the Model 770 report used for Withholding tax reporting. 

The Model 770 report is an annual report that provides information about the taxes that are withheld by a company when the company pays contractors and self-employed vendors. Companies remit the withheld taxes directly to the government throughout the year. At the end of the year, the company generates and transmits the Model 770 report, which itemizes the payments that were made and the taxes that were withheld, to each vendor. The Model 770 report contains only information about contractors and self-employed vendors for whom taxes were withheld from payments. 

## General settings required for Model 770 reporting 
Complete the following tasks before you generate a Model 770 report :

-   Set up withholding tax codes, withholding tax groups, withholding tax limits, and withholding tax values. For more information, see  [Set up withholding tax](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-withholding-tax.md) and [Withholding tax for Italy](emea-ita-withholding-tax.md).
-   Pay vendor invoices and withhold taxes from the payments.
-   Set up Italian sales tax books. For more information, see [Italian sales tax books](emea-ita-fiscal-books.md).

## Set up address information
Use the Address setup form to set up the country code, state and region code, and county and municipality codes for a self-employed vendor or contractor to include in a Model 770 report. You must set up address information for all self-employed vendors and contractors for whom you withhold taxes from payments. For information about the address codes, see the Italian government’s instructions for the Model 770 report published on the [Italian Revenue Agency](www.agenziaentrate.gov.it) website.
