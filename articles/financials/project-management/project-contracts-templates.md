# Synchronize project contracts from Project Service Automation directly to project contracts Finance and Operations

This topic describes the templates and underlying tasks that are used to synchronize project contracts directly from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use the Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution, you should be familiar with the Dynamics 365 Data integration feature.

## Data flow for Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations

The Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution uses the Data integration feature to synchronize data across instances of Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations. The integration templates that are available with the Data integration feature enable the flow of data about project contracts, projects, project contract lines, and project contract line milestones from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

The following illustration shows how the data is synchronized between Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations.

## Templates and tasks

To access the available templates, in the Microsoft PowerApps Admin Center, select **Projects**, and then, in the upper-right corner, select **New project** to select public templates.

The following template and underlying task are used to synchronize project contracts from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations:

- **Name of the template in Data integration:** Project contracts (PSA to Fin and Ops)
- **Name of the task in the project:** Project contracts PSA to Fin and Ops

Before synchronization of project contracts can occur, you must synchronize accounts.

## Entity set

| Project Service Automation | Finance and Operations                  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Orders                     | Integration entity for project contract |

## Entity flow

Project contracts are managed in Project Service Automation, and they are synchronized to Finance and Operations as project contracts. As part of the integration template, you can set the integration source in Finance and Operations for the project contract.

## Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution

The **Project contract ID** field is available on the **Project contracts** page. This field has been made a natural and unique key to support the integration.

When a new project contract is created, if a **Project contract ID** value doesn't already exist, it's automatically generated by using a number sequence. The value consists of **ORD** followed by an incrementing number sequence and then a suffix of six characters. Here is an example: **ORD-01022-Z4M9Q0**.

When the Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution is applied <TO DO: link in the top level document link where we will be adding the instructions for applying the PSA solution>, an upgrade script sets the **Project contract ID** field for existing project contracts in Project Service Automation.

## Preconditions and mapping setup

- Before synchronization of project contracts can occur, you must synchronize accounts.
- In your connection set, add an integration key field mapping for **msdyn\_organizationalunits** to **msdyn\_name \[Name\]**. You might first have to add a project to the connection set. For more information about integration keys, see Dynamics 365 Data integration.
- The **PaymentTerms** mapping must be updated so that it reflects valid terms of payment in Finance and Operations. You can also remove the mapping from the project task. The default value map has default values for demo data. The following table shows the values in Project Service Automation.

    | Value | Description   |
    |-------|---------------|
    | 1     | Net 30        |
    | 2     | 2% 10, Net 30 |
    | 3     | Net 45        |
    | 4     | Net 60        |

- **SourceDataID** can be updated to a different value or removed from the mapping. The default template value is **Project Service Automation**.

## Power Query

You must use Microsoft Power Query to filter data if these conditions are met:

- You have sales orders in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales.
- You have multiple organizational units in Project Service Automation, and these organizational units will be mapped to multiple legal entities in Finance and Operations.

If you must use Power Query, follow these guidelines:

- The Project contracts (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a default filter that includes only sales orders of the **Work item (msdyn\_ordertype = 192350001)** type. This filter helps guarantee that project contracts aren't created for sales orders in Finance and Operations. If you create your own template, you must add this filter.
- You must create a Power Query filter that includes only the contract organizations that should be synchronized to the legal entity of the integration connection set. For example, project contracts that you have with the contract organizational unit of Contoso US should be synchronized to the USSI legal entity, but project contracts that you have with the contract organizational unit of Contoso Global should be synchronized to the USMF legal entity. If you don't add this filter to your task mapping, all project contracts will be synchronized to the legal entity that is defined for the connection set,  regardless of the contract organizational unit.

## Template mapping in Data integration

> [!NOTE] 
> The **CustomerReference**, **AddressCity**, **AddressCountryRegionID**, **AddressDescription**, **AddressLine1**, **AddressLine2**, **AddressState**, and **AddressZipCode** fields aren't included in the default mapping. You can add the mappings if you require that this data be synchronized for project contracts.

The following illustration shows an example of a template mapping in Data integration.

> [!NOTE]
> The mapping shows the field information that will be synchronized from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.
