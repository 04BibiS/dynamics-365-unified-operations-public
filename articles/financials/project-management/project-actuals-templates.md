Synchronize project estimates from Project Service Automation directly to project forecasts in Finance and Operations
This topic describes the templates and underlying tasks that are used to synchronize project hour estimates and project expense estimates directly from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
[!NOTE] Project tasks integration, expense transaction categories, hour estimates, expense estimates, and functionality locking is available in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 8.0.
Data flow for Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations
The Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution uses the Data integration feature to synchronize data across instances of Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations. The integration templates that are available with the Data integration feature enable the flow of data about project hour estimates and project expense estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.
The following illustration shows how the data is synchronized between Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations.

Templates and tasks
To access the available templates, in the Microsoft PowerApps Admin Center, select Projects, and then, in the upper-right corner, select New project to select public templates.
The following template and underlying tasks are used to synchronize project hour estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations:
Name of the template in Data integration: Project hour estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops)
Name of the tasks in the project:
Transaction relationships
Expense estimates
Entity set
Project Service Automation
Finance and Operations
Project tasks
Integration entity for project hour estimates
Entity flow
Project hour estimates are managed in Project Service Automation, and they are synchronized to Finance and Operations as project hour forecasts.
Preconditions
Before synchronization of project hour estimates can occur, you must synchronize projects, project tasks, and project expense transaction categories.
Power Query
You must use Microsoft Power Query in the project hour estimates template to:
Set the Forecast model ID that will be used when the integration creates new hour forecasts.
Filter out any resource specific records within the task that will fail the integration into hour forecasts
Filter out any empty transaction category rows. Failure to do this may result in incorrect hour forecasts.
Forecast model ID
To update the default forecast model ID in the template, click the Map arrow to open the mapping. Select to open the Advanced Query and Filtering.
If you are using the default Microsoft Project hour estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template, select the Inserted Condition in the Applied Steps section. In the Function entry, replace O_forecast with the name of the Forecast model ID that should be used with the integration. The default template has a forecast model ID from the demo data.
If you are creating a new template, you must add this column. Select Add Conditional Column and give the column a name, such as ModelID. Enter the condition for the column where if Project task is not null, then; else null.
Filter out resource specific records
The Project hour estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a default filter that removes any resource specific records. If you create your own template, you must add this filter. In the Advanced Query and Filtering form, select to filter on the column msdyn_islinetask to only include False records.
Filter out empty transaction category rows
You must add a filter to remove any rows with empty transaction categories. This is needed regardless if you are using the default template or creating your own template. This filter will remove any summary rows coming from Project Service Automation that could cause the hour forecasts in Finance and Operations to be incorrect. In the Advanced Query and Filtering form, select to filter out the null records in the column msdyn_transactioncategory_value.
Template mapping in Data integration
The following illustration shows an example of the template task mapping in Data integration. The mapping shows the field information that will be synchronized from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

The following template and underlying task is used to synchronize project expense estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations:
Name of the template in Data integration: Project expense estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops)
Name of the tasks in the project: 
Transaction relationships
Expense estimates
Entity set
Project Service Automation
Finance and Operations
Transaction Connections
Integration entity for project transaction relationships.
Estimate Lines
Integration entity for project expense estimates.
Entity flow
Project expense estimates are managed in Project Service Automation, and they are synchronized to Finance and Operations as project expense forecasts.
Prerequisites
Before synchronization of project expense estimates can occur, you must synchronize Projects, Project tasks and Project expense transaction categories.
Power Query
You must use Microsoft Power Query in the project expense estimates template to:
Filter to include only expense estimate line records
Set the Forecast model ID that will be used when the integration creates new hour forecasts.
Transform the billing types.
Transform the transaction types.
Filter to include only expense estimate lines
The Project expense estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a default filter to only include expense lines in the integration. If you create your own template, you must add this filter. Select the Transaction relationships task and click the Map arrow. Select Advanced Query and filtering. Filter the msdyn_transactiontype1 column to include only msdyn_estimateline.
Forecast model ID
To update the default forecast model ID in the template, for the Expense estimates task, click the Map arrow to open the mapping. Select to open the Advanced Query and Filtering.
If you are using the default Microsoft Project expense estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template, select the first Inserted Condition in the Applied Steps section. In the Function entry, replace O_forecast with the name of the Forecast model ID that should be used with the integration. The default template has a forecast model ID from the demo data.
If you are creating a new template, you must add this column. Select Add Conditional Column and give the column a name, such as ModelID. Enter the condition for the column where if Estimate line ID is not null, then < enter the forecast model ID >; else null.
Transform the billing types
The Project expense estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a conditional column added to transform the billing types received from Project Service Automation during the integration.
If you create your own template, you must add this conditional column. In the Advanced Query and Filtering form, select Add Conditional Column. Give the column a name, such as "BillingType". The condition to enter is as follows:
If msdyn_billingtype = 192350000, then NonChargeable else if msdyn_billingtype = 192350001, then Chargeable else if msdyn_billingtype = 192350002, then Complimentary else NotAvailable
Transform the transaction types
The Project expense estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a conditional column added to transform the transaction types received from Project Service Automation during the integration.
If you create your own template, you must add this conditional column. In the Advanced Query and Filtering form, select Add Conditional Column. Give the column a name, such as "TransactionType". The condition to enter is as follows: If msdyn_transactiontypecode = 192350000, then Cost else if msdyn_transactiontypecode = 192350005, then Sales else null
Template mapping in Data integration
The following illustrations show examples of the template task mappings in Data integration. The mapping shows the field information that will be synchronized from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.
