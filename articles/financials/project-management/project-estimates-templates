# Synchronize project estimates from Project Service Automation directly to project forecasts in Finance and Operations

This topic decribes the templates and underlying tasks that are used to synchronize project hour estimates and project expense estimates directly from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

## Data flow for Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations

The Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution uses the Data integration feature to synchronize data across instances of Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations. The integration templates that are available with the Data integration feature enable the flow of data about project hour estimates and project expense estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

The following illustration shows how the data is synchronized between Project Service Automation adn Finance and Operations.

## Templates and tasks

To access the available templates, in the Microsoft PowerApps Admin Center, select **Projects**, and then, in the upper-right corner, select **New project** to select public templates.

The following template and underlying task is used to synchronize project hour estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations:

-**Name of the template in Data integration:** Project hour estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops)
-**Name of the task in the project:** HourEstimates

## Entity set

| Project Service Automation      | Finance and Operations                          |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Project Tasks                   | Integration entity for project hour estimates   |

## Entity flow

Project hour estimates are managed in Project Service Automation, and they are synchronized to Finance and Operations as project hour forecasts.

## Preconditions

Before synchronization of project hour estimates can occur, you must synchronize Projects, Project tasks and Project expense transaction categories.

## Power Query

You must use Microsoft Power Query in the project hour estimates template to:
- Set the **Forecast model ID** that will be used when the integration creates new hour forecasts.
- Filter out any resource specific records within the task that will fail the integration into hour forecasts
- Filter out any empty transaction category rows. Failure to do this may result in incorrect hour forecasts.

### Forecast model ID
To update the default forecast model ID in the template, click on the **Map** arrow to open the mapping. Select to open the Advanced Query and Filtering.
- If you are using the default Microsoft Project hour estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template, select the **Inserted Condition** in the **Applied Steps** section. In the **Function** entry, replace **O_forecast** with the name of the **Forecast model ID** that should be used with the integration. The default template has a forecast model ID from the demo data.
- If you are creating a new template, you must add this column. Select **Add Conditional Column** and give the column a name, such as ModelID. Enter the condition for the column where if Project task is not null, then <enter the forecast model ID>; else null.

### Filter out resource specific records
The Project hour estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a defualt filter that removes any resource specific records. If you create your own template, you must add this filter. In the Advanced Query and Filtering form, select to filter on the column **msdyn_islinetask** to only include **False** records.

### Filter out empty transaction category rows
You must add a filter to remove any rows with empty transaction categories whether you are using the default template or creating your own template. This filter will remove any summary rows coming from Project Service Automation that could cause the hour forecasts in Finance and Operations to be incorrect. In the Advanced Query and Filtering form, select to filter out the null records in the column **msdyn_transactioncategory_value**.

## Template mapping in Data integration

The following illustration shows an example of the template task mapping in Data integration.

The following template and underlying task is used to synchronize project expense estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations:

-**Name of the template in Data integration:** Project expense estimates (PSA to Fin and Ops)
-**Name of the tasks in the project:**

--Transaction relationships
--Expense estimates
