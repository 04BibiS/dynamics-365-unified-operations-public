**Project timesheets on a mobile device**

Overview
--------

My timesheets (Optimized for mobile) allows employees to create and submit
project timesheets to record their hours for a specific project on a mobile
device. Employees can create a new timesheet from scratch or copy data from an
existing timesheet to ensure rapid, accurate time entry. If you are designated
as a delegate, you can also enter a timesheet for another worker. The app allows
employees to filter by project, resource or approval status to quickly locate
and select a timesheet. It also provides employees with the ability to save
favorites, which saves the project and activity information on the timesheet.
The saved favorites can be used to create future timesheets, speeding the time
entry process. Editing or viewing financial dimension information is not
supported from the mobile app. My timesheets (Optimized for mobile) can be
accessed via the web browser on your mobile device.

Timesheets for my review (Optimized for mobile) allows project managers who have
timesheet approval rights to review and approve project timesheets on a mobile
device. Editing or viewing financial dimension information is not supported from
the mobile app. Timesheets for my review (Optimized for mobile) can be accessed
via the web browser on your mobile device.

This mobile application is compatible for iPhone with Platform update 15.
Android will be compatible with Platform update 16, when it becomes available.
