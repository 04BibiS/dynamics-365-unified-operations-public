# Rename or modify a project stage

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Project stages can serve as a guide to the project life cycle. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations provides five predefined project stages and three user-defined stages. You can update the name of a project stage that you are using to track the progress of projects. You can also provide names for user-defined status names. This task shows how to rename or modify the name of a project stage and uses the USSI data set.

1. Go to Project management and accounting > Setup > Project management and accounting parameters.
2. Click the Project stage tab.
3. In the list, find and select the Stage to rename.
4. In the Project stage field, update the Project stage name.
5. Click Save.
