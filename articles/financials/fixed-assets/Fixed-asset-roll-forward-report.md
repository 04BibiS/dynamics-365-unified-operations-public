# Fixed assets roll forward report

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **Fixed assets roll forward** report provides detailed fixed asset data you need for period closing, financial statements, and tax reporting in an easy to read Excel format. The report includes fixed asset starting and ending balances with valuation movements for the period, along with any new asset acquisitions and disposals that occurred during the period. Data is reported for individual fixed assets as well as summarized values for fixed asset groups and the legal entity.

The Fixed asset roll forward report utilizes the Electronic reporting framework. You must have the Fixed assets model and Fixed asset roll forward configurations imported from LCS before you can run the report. For instructions, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs).

This report is available on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3, or as a hotfix on the July 2017 release. Environments with the July 2017 release will need three hotfixes applied:

- **KB 4041754**: Electronic reporting (ER) configuration can’t be downloaded from LCS as not applicable for the current application version after applying the platform update package

- **KB 4056107**: Electronic reporting (GER) cumulative update 5

- **KB 4056353**: Fixed assets Statement and Notes reports don't meet the requirements in GAAP and IFRS

The following fields are available on the report.
