# Personal expenses on an expense report

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

During business travel, workers may sometimes charge personal expenses to their corporate credit cards. If you do not define a process for 
personal expenses, the approval process for expense reports may be disrupted when workers submit their itemized expense reports. 
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, there are two methods for dealing with a worker's personal expenses:

**Paid by employee** – Your organization does not pay the personal expenses on the corporate credit card bill. Instead, it creates a 
report that displays personal expenses together with the corporate expenses that were charged to the corporate credit card. 

**Paid by company** – Your organization pays the whole corporate credit card bill, and then debits the worker’s account for the personal
expenses. 

You can select the method that you want to use for your organization in the **Expense management parameters** page.
