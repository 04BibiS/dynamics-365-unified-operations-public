# Electronic messaging

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview and setup information for electronic messaging in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Recent trends in requirements addressed to the reporting sphere from Government and legislative authority of different countries all over the world are aimed at implementing the possibility of obtaining data from companies registered in the country in electronic format directly from the systems were this data is
accounted, stored and processed. Electronic Messages functionality (EM) supports different processes of electronical interoperation between Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and systems offered by Governments and legislative authorities for reporting, submission and receiving official information.

EM integrates with the Electronic Reporting (ER) module which allows you to set up electronic report formats. To learn about electronic reporting, see <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting>.

Electronic messaging is based on the following entities:

-   **Electronic Message** – a report or declaration which should be reported and/or transmitted internally. For example, a report that is sent to a tax office.

-   **Electronic Message items** – records which should be included in the message to be reported.

-   **Electronic message processing** – chain of linked among each other or not linked **Actions** which should be executed to collect necessary data, generate report(s), store it in Azure blob, transmit report to the outside of the system, get a response from outside of the system, update database respectively to the information received.

![Electronic messaging data flow](media/electronic-messaging-data-flow.png)

**Electronic messages** supports the following scenarios:

-   Manually create messages and generate reports basing on associated exported GER format of different types (Microsoft Excel, XML, JSON, PDF, TEXT, Microsoft Word)

-   Automatically create and process messages based on information that was requested and obtained from an authority via an associated importing GER format.

-   Collect and process information from a data source AX tables as Message items.

-   Store additional information and evaluate different values via calling specifically defined executable classes in relation with Messages or Message
    items.

-   Aggregate information collected in Message items split it by Messages, generate report(s) basing on exporting GER formats.

-   Transmit generated reports to a web-service using security information stored in Key Vault.

-   Get response from a web-service, interpret it and update data in AX respectively.

-   Store and review all the generated reports.

-   Store and review all the log information related to actions executed for a Message or Message item.

-   Control the processing basing on different Message statuses and Message items statuses.

## Set up electronic messaging

**Electronic Messages** functionality is provided to maintain different processes of electronic reporting of different document types.

Basically, features delivered by Microsoft may have a complex setup of EM functionality composed of combination of many different Message statuses, Message items statuses, Actions, Additional fields, Executable classes and soon. This is why for such features Microsoft deliver a package of data entities which includes predefined and tested setup data for a particular processing covering a feature. This package should be imported to a particular Legal entity
via Data management tool. To know more about how to use Data management tool refer: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages>.

To get **Electronic Messages** functionality ready manually (without importing predefined setup via data entities) you need to set up the following:

-   Number sequence for Messages and Message items
-   Message item types
-   Message item statuses
-   Message statuses
-   Additional fields
-   Populate records actions
-   Executable class settings
-   Web services settings
-   Message processing actions
-   Electronic message processing

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        ### Number sequences
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        Message number sequence will be used for auto-numbering Messages. This is a unique identifier of a Message in the table.
        Open **General Ledger parameters** (**Tax > Setup > Parameters > General Ledger parameters**) and set up a non-continuous number        sequence for “Message” Reference. This number sequence will be used for numbering messages on their generation.
        “Message items” number sequence will be used for auto-numbering Message items. This is a unique identifier of a Message item in         the table. Open **General Ledger parameters** (**Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** \> **General Ledger parameters**) and set         up a non-continuous number sequence for “Message items” Reference. This number sequence will be used for numbering
        message items on their population from the source tables.

### Electronic message processing


**Electronic message processing** is a basic concept of the **Electronic messages** functionality. It aggregates actions which should be evaluated for the Electronic message. Where actions can be linked via initial and result status or started independently (User processing action type). On **Electronic message processing** page user may also select Additional fields which should be supported for the processing.

**Action fast tab** serves to allow user to add predefined actions to the processing. It is possible to define if an action must be run separately (for user actions it is mandatory) or can be initiated by processing.

**Message item additional fields fast tab** serves to allow user to add predefined Additional fields which will relate to Message items. You need to add Additional fields for each type Message items for which it is applicable.

**Message additional fields fast tab** serves to allow user to add predefined Additional fields which will relate to Messages.

**Security roles fast tab** serves to set up security roles predefined in the system for a specific processing. A user within a role will see processing defined for this role only.

**Batch fast tab** serves to set up a processing to work in batch regime.

## Work with Electronic Messages functionality

There are two forms to work with Electronic messages functionality:

-   **Electronic messages** (**Tax** \> **Inquires and reports** \> **Electronic
    messages** \> **Electronic messages**)

-   **Electronic message items** (**Tax** \> **Inquires and reports** \>
    **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic message items**)

Depending on how a processing is setup user may use one form or another or both. If a user operates on Message level **Electronic messages** form would be more useful. In case of operating on data collection (Message items) level -**Electronic message items** form will be more useful.

### Electronic messages 


**Electronic message**s form presents processing available to user according to his (her) role associated in the setup of the processing.

For each of the processing available for user, the form shows Electronic messages and related to them information.

**Messages fast tab** shows Electronic messages for the selected processing. Depending on status of the selected message and predefined processing, user may run some actions by clicking on “fast” buttons of the grid:

-   “New” – is associated with actions of “Create message” type.

-   “Delete” - is active when for the current status of the selected message, “Allow delete” parameter is marked.

-   “Generate report” – is associated with actions of “Electronic reporting export message” type.

-   “Send report” – is associated with actions of “Web service” type.

-   “Update status” – is associated with actions of “Message level user processing” type.

-   “Message items” – opens Electronic message items form.

**Action log fast tab** shows information about all the actions executed for the selected message.

**Message additional fields fast tab** shows all the defined for messages in processing setup additional fields and their values.

**Message items fast tab** shows all message items related to the selected message.

User may review all the attachments (already generated and received reports) for the selected message. To do so, select a message for which you want to review a report and click on **Attachment** button on the **Main menu**:

![](media/da3488121c1641353318ce43528608cf.png)

Thus, you will see a form where you may review all the attachments related to the message. To see the file, select a file in the list on the left side and click on **Open** button on the **Main menu**:

![](media/70eb269745c4f27519d239309a1e7673.png)

If you need to review an attachment related to a specific action previously executed with a message, select this message, open **Action log fast tab,** select an action and click on Attachment button as it is shown before.

It is also possible to run the whole processing or by action using generic “Run processing” button on Action pane.
