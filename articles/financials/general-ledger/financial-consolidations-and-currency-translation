# Financial consolidations and currency translation

This document takes you through the approach that both Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and Financial reporting use for consolidations. It describes scenarios that involve multi-company reporting, aggregation, elimination, and minority interest. It also explains how to handle special situations, such as scenarios where legal entities have different fiscal periods or different charts of accounts.

This document was written for users and functional consultants, and it assumes that readers have a general understanding of Finance and Operations and Financial reporting. Basic setup isn’t covered.

Note: The term legal entity is used in Finance and Operations, and the term company is used in Financial reporting. Both these terms are used in this document. However, for the purposes of this document, their meanings are the same.

# Audience

This document is intended for finance and accounting users and application consultants who want to use Finance and Reporting and Financial reporting to consolidate multi-company and multi-currency data.

# Approach

Finance and Operations uses a separate legal entity to process a consolidation. It enables single-instance consolidation but provides an option to bring in data from other sources. The consolidation process must be run every time that changes are made in the source legal entities.

Financial reporting can consolidate multiple companies during report generation. Although the data is stored in a data mart, is versioned, and can be exported, every source company is the owner and container of the data. The report can be run at any time, even every minute (for example). It provides many additional benefits, such as the ability to drill down to all companies and dimensions.
The following illustrations show the steps for doing consolidation in Finance and Operations and Financial reporting.
Users can use Consolidation Online, Financial reporting, or a combination. Their choice depends on the needs of their company and the preferences of their auditors.

# Consolidations
The **Consolidations** module includes options for consolidating multiple legal entities during the consolidation process, and for importing or exporting a company’s balance. You can also set up eliminations and post elimination journals.
# Benefits of using Consolidate online
Customers who use the Consolidations module will gain various benefits:
- **Depth of data** – You can create consolidated reports that bring together actual and budget data at both the account level and the dimension level.
- **Dynamic consolidations** – Consolidations can be processed multiple times.
- **Audit capabilities** – Dimensions and accounts are maintained for analysis and audit, and balances are created by date.
- **Currency translation** – You can set up the account ranges and rates to translate from the accounting currency of the source company to the accounting currency of the consolidation company.
- **Process eliminations in a consolidated or elimination company** – You can process and post eliminations as a single process during consolidation. Alternatively, you can run a proposal separately.
# Supported consolidation scenarios
Here are some of the consolidation scenarios that Consolidate online supports:
- Single-level consolidations across legal entities
- Consolidations that involve eliminations
- Minority interest (For this scenario, manual calculation and entry in the company must be used.)
- Multiple charts of accounts across legal entities
- Different fiscal calendars across multiple legal entities
- Consolidations that involve multiple reporting currencies
# Legal entity setup
Before you process a consolidation, you must set up the legal entity. You can run consolidation as many times as you require, and all data will be translated from the source company’s accounting currency to the currency that is defined for the consolidation company. Therefore, for the following organizational structure, if you must translate all North American companies first to US dollars (USD) and then to euros (EUR), the currency of the parent company, you must have at least two consolidation companies.
 
In the preceding organizational structure, you must have a legal entity for the North American consolidation, because consolidations always consolidate from the accounting currency of the source company to the currency of the consolidation company. In the example, if all companies are included in a single consolidation, the Mexican subsidiary will be translated from Mexican pesos (MXN) to EUR, not from MXN to USD to EUR.
When you create the legal entity, you can specify whether the company is used for both the consolidation process and the elimination process, or for just one of those processes. In the following illustration, the company is used for both processes. Note that you can’t post daily journals in a consolidation company, but you can post them in an elimination company. Therefore, you might want to have a separate elimination company.
 
# Main accounts and consolidation account groups
One of the choices that you must make is how you want to consolidate your chart of accounts. During the consolidation process, you have three options for consolidating main accounts.
The first option is to use the main accounts from the source companies. In this case, every account from all companies will be consolidated. For example, if Cash is account 100000 in the USMF company and account 1100 in the DEMF company, the consolidation company will include both accounts, each of which will have its respective balance.
The second option is to specify a default consolidation account on the **Main accounts** page. The account will then be mapped to the consolidation account. This option can be helpful when you have different charts of accounts or must map to a chart that is defined by the headquarters.
 
The third option is to use consolidation account groups. You can define as many consolidation account groups as you require. Then, on the **Additional consolidation accounts** page, you just map the main account from the chart of accounts to the account that you require for that group.
 
# Consolidate online
After you’ve completed your setup, you enter the details of the consolidation on the **Consolidate [Online]** page. When you’ve finished, you can click **OK** or **Batch** to process the consolidation.
## Criteria
On the **Criteria** tab of the **Consolidate [Online]** page, you define the accounts, periods, and type of data that is being consolidated.
 
Here is an explanation of the various fields on this tab:
- **Description** – Enter a precise description for the period that you’re consolidating.
- **Main account** – Use the fields in this section to define the main accounts that will be processed.
- **From** and **To** – Specify a range of accounts to process. If you leave these fields blank, all accounts from all companies will be moved to the consolidation company. Therefore, if you’re consolidating four companies, and each company has a different chart of accounts, all accounts from all four companies will be created in the consolidation company.
- **Use consolidation account** – If you set this option to **Yes**, the **Select consolidation account from** field becomes available. In this field, select whether you want to consolidate all accounts to the consolidation account that is set on the **Main accounts** page, or whether you want to select the account from one of the consolidation account groups.
- **Consolidation account group** – Select the group to use for the main account mapping for the consolidation.
- **Consolidation period** – Use the fields in this section to define the consolidation period.
- **From** and **To** – Specify a range of dates for the consolidation. If you leave these fields blank, the consolidation will be processed for all periods that are defined in the ledger calendar for the company.
- **Include actual amounts** – Set this option to **Yes** to consolidate your actual data.
- **Include budget amounts** – Set this option to **Yes** to consolidate data from the budget register.
- **Rebuild balances during consolidation** – We don’t recommend to that you set this option to **Yes**. Instead, process it as a separate batch job.
- **Budget models** – If you’ve selected to consolidate budget data, use the fields in this section to define the budget models.
- **From** and **To** – Specify the range of models to use.
- **Budget rate type** – Select the type of budget rate to use for currency translation of budget
data.
# Financial dimensions
On the **Financial dimension** tab, you define the dimensions that should be included in the consolidation company. To select a dimension, set the **Specification** field to **Dimension**, and then define the order of the dimension in the consolidation company.
 
Regardless of the order that you define, Main account will always be the first segment.
# Legal entities
On the **Legal entities** tab, you define the companies that should be included in the consolidation company. You also define the ownership percentage of those companies. If you specify less than 100-percent ownership, the specified percentage will be rolled up to the consolidation company. For any translation differences, the **Account type for conversion differences** field is used to select the main account from the setup on the **Accounts for automatic transactions** page.
 
 
# Elimination
On the **Elimination** tab, you have three options for processing eliminations:
- Select the elimination rule, and then, in the **Proposal options** field, select **Proposal only**. This option will process the elimination during the consolidation process, but it won’t post everything in one step. You can post the journal later.
- Select the elimination rule, and then, in the **Proposal options** field, select **Post only**. This option will process the elimination during the consolidation process and post everything in one step.
- Run an elimination proposal separately from the consolidation process by using the elimination journal.
 
For more information about eliminations see the Elimination rules section later in this document.
# Currency translation
On the Currency translation tab, you define the legal entity, account and exchange rate type, and rate.
Three options are available in the **Apply exchange rate from** field:
- **Consolidation date** – The date of the consolidation will be used to get the exchange rate. This rate is equivalent to the spot or month-end rate. You will see a preview of the rate, but you can’t edit it.
- **Transaction date** – The date of each transaction will be used to select an exchange rate. This option is most often used for fixed assets and is often referred to as a historical rate. You can’t see a preview of the rate, because there will be many rates for the various transactions in the account range.
- **User defined rate** – After you select this option, you can enter the exchange rate that you want. This option can be useful for average exchange rates or if you’re consolidating against a fixed exchange rate.
 
# Managing consolidation transactions
To view the results of the consolidation, you have multiple options:
- Generate a financial report against the consolidation company.
- Review the **Trial balance** list page in the consolidation company.
- In the list of consolidation transactions on the **Consolidations** page, view the balances that are created by date for every source company for every period.
 
To run the consolidation again, you can just process the consolidation. Alternatively, you can first click Remove the transactions on the Consolidations page.
