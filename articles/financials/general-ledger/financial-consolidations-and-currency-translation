# Financial consolidations and currency translation

This document takes you through the approach that both Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and Financial reporting use for consolidations. It describes scenarios that involve multi-company reporting, aggregation, elimination, and minority interest. It also explains how to handle special situations, such as scenarios where legal entities have different fiscal periods or different charts of accounts.

This document was written for users and functional consultants, and it assumes that readers have a general understanding of Finance and Operations and Financial reporting. Basic setup isn’t covered.
Note: The term legal entity is used in Finance and Operations, and the term company is used in Financial reporting. Both these terms are used in this document. However, for the purposes of this document, their meanings are the same.

# Audience

This document is intended for finance and accounting users and application consultants who want to use Finance and Reporting and Financial reporting to consolidate multi-company and multi-currency data.

# Approach 

Finance and Operations uses a separate legal entity to process a consolidation. It enables single-instance consolidation but provides an option to bring in data from other sources. The consolidation process must be run every time that changes are made in the source legal entities.
Financial reporting can consolidate multiple companies during report generation. Although the data is stored in a data mart, is versioned, and can be exported, every source company is the owner and container of the data. The report can be run at any time, even every minute (for example). It provides many additional benefits, such as the ability to drill down to all companies and dimensions.
The following illustrations show the steps for doing consolidation in Finance and Operations and Financial reporting.
Users can use Consolidation Online, Financial reporting, or a combination. Their choice depends on the needs of their company and the preferences of their auditors.

# Consolidations

The **Consolidations** module includes options for consolidating multiple legal entities during the consolidation process, and for importing or exporting a company’s balance. You can also set up eliminations and post elimination journals.

# Benefits of using Consolidate online

Customers who use the Consolidations module will gain various benefits:

- **Depth of data** – You can create consolidated reports that bring together actual and budget data at both the account level and the dimension level.
- **Dynamic consolidations** – Consolidations can be processed multiple times.
- **Audit capabilities** – Dimensions and accounts are maintained for analysis and audit, and balances are created by date.
- **Currency translation** – You can set up the account ranges and rates to translate from the accounting currency of the source company to the accounting currency of the consolidation company.
- **Process eliminations in a consolidated or elimination company** – You can process and post eliminations as a single process during consolidation. Alternatively, you can run a proposal separately.

# Supported consolidation scenarios

Here are some of the consolidation scenarios that Consolidate online supports:

- Single-level consolidations across legal entities
- Consolidations that involve eliminations
- Minority interest (For this scenario, manual calculation and entry in the company must be used.)
- Multiple charts of accounts across legal entities
- Different fiscal calendars across multiple legal entities
- Consolidations that involve multiple reporting currencies

# Legal entity setup

Before you process a consolidation, you must set up the legal entity. You can run consolidation as many times as you require, and all data will be translated from the source company’s accounting currency to the currency that is defined for the consolidation company. Therefore, for the following organizational structure, if you must translate all North American companies first to US dollars (USD) and then to euros (EUR), the currency of the parent company, you must have at least two consolidation companies.
 
In the preceding organizational structure, you must have a legal entity for the North American consolidation, because consolidations always consolidate from the accounting currency of the source company to the currency of the consolidation company. In the example, if all companies are included in a single consolidation, the Mexican subsidiary will be translated from Mexican pesos (MXN) to EUR, not from MXN to USD to EUR.
When you create the legal entity, you can specify whether the company is used for both the consolidation process and the elimination process, or for just one of those processes. In the following illustration, the company is used for both processes. Note that you can’t post daily journals in a consolidation company, but you can post them in an elimination company. Therefore, you might want to have a separate elimination company.
 
# Main accounts and consolidation account groups

One of the choices that you must make is how you want to consolidate your chart of accounts. During the consolidation process, you have three options for consolidating main accounts.
The first option is to use the main accounts from the source companies. In this case, every account from all companies will be consolidated. For example, if Cash is account 100000 in the USMF company and account 1100 in the DEMF company, the consolidation company will include both accounts, each of which will have its respective balance.
The second option is to specify a default consolidation account on the **Main accounts** page. The account will then be mapped to the consolidation account. This option can be helpful when you have different charts of accounts or must map to a chart that is defined by the headquarters.
 
The third option is to use consolidation account groups. You can define as many consolidation account groups as you require. Then, on the **Additional consolidation accounts** page, you just map the main account from the chart of accounts to the account that you require for that group.
 
# Consolidate online

After you’ve completed your setup, you enter the details of the consolidation on the **Consolidate [Online]** page. When you’ve finished, you can click **OK** or **Batch** to process the consolidation.

## Criteria

On the **Criteria** tab of the **Consolidate [Online]** page, you define the accounts, periods, and type of data that is being consolidated.
 
Here is an explanation of the various fields on this tab:

- **Description** – Enter a precise description for the period that you’re consolidating.
- **Main account** – Use the fields in this section to define the main accounts that will be processed.
