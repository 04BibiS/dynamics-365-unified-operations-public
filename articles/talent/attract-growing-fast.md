# Dynamics 365 for Talent: Attract is Growing Fast! 
 
> [!NOTE] 
> This document applies to Dynamics 365 for Talent: Attract. 
 
As part of our continuous roll out of product capabilities we want to let customers experience new features as soon as possible.  Administrators can enable the use of preview features in their environment. These features are nearly ready for general availability and have gone through extensive testing.  We are just looking for a final round of customer feedback and validation before we generally release them. 

This document describes how an administrator can enable the preview features and lists the features that are currently enabled for preview. This list will be maintained as features release to general availability and when new features are released to preview. No notification is made when new features are delivered to preview; users will simply start seeing the features. 

## Managing Preview Features 

The enabling of preview features is environment specific. To enable the features an administrator of Attract will need to perform the following steps: 

1. Log in to Attract 

2. Select the ‘gear’ menu in the upper right-hand corner, and select ‘Admin settings’ 

3. Select the ‘Feature management’ tab on the left. 

4. Click the switch next to ‘Preview features’ so that it turns blue. 

5. Refresh your browser to begin seeing the new features. (Any user already logged in will see them the next time they login or they can see them immediately by also refreshing their browser.) 

NOTE: The same steps can be followed for disabling the preview capabilities.  When disabling them note existing processes could have potential issues.  In most cases existing processes will continue to use the preview features.  New processes created after disabling the preview features will not use any of the preview features. 
 
## Feedback 

Good or bad, we want to hear from you regarding your use of these preview features. Please use these two sites regularly as you use these ore any other features: 

Community – This site is a great tool for users to discuss use cases, ask questions, and get community help. 
Ideas – Use this site for suggesting product ideas. Let us know about features you would like to see in the product and what changes you would like to be made to existing features/ 

## Current Features in Preview 

> Job Templates – Ability to create hiring process templates. Currently users can customize the hiring process for a given job.  With this feature they can first create a template of the process and then select the appropriate template at the time of job creation, thus streamlining the job setup process. 

> Career site – The current version of the career site simply lists all open jobs. This will be expanded in the future with additional capabilities. Jobs can be marked as internal or external and thus if an internal user logs into the site they will see the internal and external jobs.  Otherwise non-internal users or non-logged in users will only see external jobs. 
Job Posting – Ability to post jobs to the career site. 

> LinkedIn Job Posting – Ability to post jobs to LinkedIn. 

> [!Note]
> Customers will need to be subscribers to one or more of LinkedIn’s job listing products for the job to be truly visible.  Otherwise the job will only show when explicitly searched for.  Posting to LinkedIn does have a delay and it can take up to a few hours for it to appear after posting it from Attract. 

> Candidate apply – Candidates (Internal or External) can now apply directly from the job page of the career site. 

> Assessments – As part of the configurable hiring process (on a job or using a job template) users now have access to a new Assessment activity type.  From here users can use the Gauge tool (part of Dynamics 365 for Talent) to build basic assessments to send to candidates.  Gauge itself is also in public preview.  Additional providers will be added in the future. 

> Coming soon! Offer Management – Offer management provides the ability for users to build templatized offer letters with placeholders.  As a candidate advances to the Offer stage, recruiters and hiring managers can now use Offer to prepare the candidates formal offer via the templates, send for internal approval, and finally send the offer for signature to the candidate.  Many new features will come to the Offer tool over time and the preview will be update with these capabilities as we are ready to release them to preview. 

> [!TIP]
> Bookmark this page and check back often to keep up to date on new preview features as we release them.
