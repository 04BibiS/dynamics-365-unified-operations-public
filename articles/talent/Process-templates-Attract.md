Creating a Process template in Attract
======================================

A **Process template** contains all the activities that should be included as
part of a hiring process for a job. This topic describes the elements of a
process template in Attract and provides a guide on creating a template. 

**Using templates**
-------------------

Organizations can choose whether to allow team members to create hiring process
templates in Attract or only allow the Admin to create templates. To configure
**Template management**, navigate to **Admin Center** --> **Template management.** Turn
Template management on to allow team members to create their own hiring process
templates.

**Note:**  Creating templates is part of the Comprehensive Hiring Add-on for Attract. 

**Creating a process template**
-------------------------------

A template can be created by either an admin, recruiter or hiring manager. A
**Process template** consists of **Stages** and **Activities**. Stages group one
or more activities together. Every process template will have a **Prospect**,
**Application**, and **Offer** activity. The **Stages** that contain these
activities can be renamed. Additional stages can be added by selecting ‘+ New
Stage’. One or more activities can be added to a Stage by dragging and dropping
into the appropriate stage or by double clicking on the activity in the
Activities list.

To learn more about the Activities, see **Activities in Attract** document.

**Default template**
--------------------

Only Admins can set the default template. Set the default template in Admin
CenterTemplate management and click on the ellipses of a template card. Select
‘Set as default’. The default template will be used if a template is not
selected when creating a job.

    appropriate stage OR by double clicking the activity and selecting which
