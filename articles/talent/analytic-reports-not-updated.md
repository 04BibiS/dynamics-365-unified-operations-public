# Analytic reports are not being updated

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

**Issue:**

The customer's data changes don't show up on the **Analytics** tabs of any of their workspaces.

**Cause:**

By default, Power BI reports are refreshed every 4 hours as the “deploy measurement” batch job is scheduled.

**Resolution:**

This may just be timing. The steps below list the process to initiate the batch job and update the analytics workspaces.

1.  Navigate to the batch jobs page at **System administration > Links > Batch jobs > Batch jobs**, or use **Search** and enter “Batch Jobs”.

1.  Find the **Deploy measurement** job in the list.

1.  Select the **Edit** button on the top of the page and set the scheduled start date/time to a value that will refresh the analytics closer to the current time.
