[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

**Issue:**

After duplicating a Security Role and logging in as that new Role you were not
able to see addresses that were marked as private. In order to resolve this
issue, you need to perform the following steps with the duplicated security
role.

**Resolution:**

1. Navigate to Organization administration/Global address book/Global address
book parameters.

2. Select Private location security

3. Move the new security role from the Available Roles list to the Selected
Roles list and save.
