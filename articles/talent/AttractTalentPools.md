Sourcing with Talent Pools
=========================

Recruiters and hiring managers can organize their candidates using Talent pools
capability. There are hundreds to thousands of candidates who are applying for
jobs at your organization, the ones who are being sourced, you never want these
candidates to be lost amongst these numbers. This is where these talent pools
can come in handy to keep an eye on all the talent.

Any user with Recruiter, Hiring Manager or AttractAdmin role can create Talent
pools. The owner of the Talent pool can also share this pool with other users.
This helps groups of users, especially recruiters look at a common pool of
