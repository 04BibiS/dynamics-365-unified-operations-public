**Build 8.1.1056**

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Core HR.


## Changes

• Last Day worked not set when hiring and also setting an employment end date
• US compliance references removed when in non US companies (ACA, ADA and I9)
• Invalid dates (1/1/1900) hidden on analytics pages
• Misc. fixes have been inlcuded in this release

## Known Issue

**Issue:** When adding a new attachment to a worker, the **New** and **Edit** buttons are grayed out. **Workaround:** Before opening the attachment page, make sure that the fact boxes on the **Worker** page are closed. If the fact boxes are closed when the **Worker** page is loaded, the attachments buttons will be enabled. (This issue will be fixed in the next platform update.)
