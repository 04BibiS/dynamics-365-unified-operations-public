Extensibility 
==============

Built atop the Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps platform, Dynamics 365 for
Talent can be extended in a variety of ways using the Power Platform and the
capabilities offered by CDS for Apps. This enables you to configure and
personalize the system using Power Apps and Power Flow, as well as get
additional people analytics using Power BI. The hiring process is more adaptable
than ever with the addition of custom activities such as PowerApps, Web content
(iFrame) and Microsoft Forms. You can tailor the hiring process to suit your
business needs and processes with these new types of activities and ensure that
both the hiring team and candidates have a seamless, customized experience.
