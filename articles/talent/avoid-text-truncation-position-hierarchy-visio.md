# How to avoid text truncation on position hierarchy and export to Visio

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]


**ISSUE:**

When I view the position hierarchy in Talent the names of individuals and
positions are truncated, making it impossible to screenshot / print the
hierarchy and distribute.

**Cause:**

By design.  

 **Resolution:**

Unfortunately the size of the text is not something that is easily modified by
the user.However, you can export out of Talent and an import into Visio. This
article was written for AX 2012, but the process is still applicable for Talent
as well.

Steps to export to Visio

1.  Open the positions list. (note if you want to include more information in
    the Org structure diagram, add fields to the Position list to make them
    available during the Wizard Phase below.

some hierarchy related information.
