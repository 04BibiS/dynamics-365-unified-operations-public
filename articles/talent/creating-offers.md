Creating, Approving & Signing offers
====================================

Preparing an offer package for a candidate needs to be a very quick process.
Using the templates set up by the administrator, it cuts down the time and
effort for the offer creators to prepare and send offers out to the candidate.

Create offer
------------

When a candidate is moved the offer stage and the use of offer management app
was turned to On, you can start preparing offer package for the candidate.
Currently, any user with a hiring manager or a recruiter role on a job can
create the offer for the candidate. Steps to prepare the offer are as follows:

1.  Navigate to the job and the candidate application you are creating the offer
    for.

2.  Go to **Offer stage** and click **Prepare offer**.

3.  You will be redirected to offer app where you can see the same candidate in
    a **New** status. You can also see other offers that you are part of, either
    as a creator or an approver.

4.  Click **Prepare Offer** and you will be given a choice of different offer
    packages that has been available by the admin to use for Offer creation.

5.  Select the desired package and click **Done** to start preparing the offer

6.  The offer package template will now load with the corresponding job and
    candidate details in there.

7.  You can see all the offer data placeholders which are present across the
    offer package in the landing experience. You can use this screen to populate
    all the values across the package.

8.  Alternatively, you can also see all the offer document templates that are
    part of this offer package.

9.  You can also edit the content of the offer depending on the admin
    configuration.

10. If there were documents marked as non-required, offer creators can choose to
    remove those documents from the package as well.

11. Once all the offer data placeholders are populated, you can **save** the
    offer draft version.

12. You can delete the draft version of the offer if there were mistakes or you
    want to start from scratch. If an incorrect package were selected, you can
    also **change the package template** and apply to this offer package.

Approve offer
-------------

Most offers need to go through an approval process to make sure it meets the
necessary standards. If an offer were made non-standard, i.e., the offer creator
did not follow the offer data rules and overrode the values in the offer, the
approval process is mandated. Steps to send an offer for approval:

1.  When the offer is in a draft state, use the **approver panel** on the screen
    to add approvers. **Hiring Managers are added as approver by default**. You
    can choose any user from your organization as an approver for the offer.

2.  Depending on the approval configuration by the admin, you can have approvers
    in a sequential or on a parallel approval method.

3.  If the approval process is sequential, you can choose to edit the sequence
    of approvers

4.  Once the approval chain is identified, click **Send to approvers**

5.  If the offer was non-standard, the offer creators needs to justify the
    non-standard nature of the offer.

6.  You can now edit the content of the approval email and send the notification
    out to the approvers.

7.  The offer creator is returned If the recruiter chooses to **skip an
    approver**, they can record a note and skip them to the next approver.

Next-up, the approvers will receive an email for them to approve the offer. They
can click the link in the email to open the offer approver view, look at the
entire offer package and approve or send the offer back to the offer creator.
Offer approvers also need to add an additional note if the offer package was
being rejected for further edits. If the offer creator had created a new version
of the offer before the approver could act, they won’t be able to approve or
reject the offer.

Offer versioning 
-----------------

Once the offer has been approved or sent back to make further edits, offer
creator can choose the **Enable editing** option to create a new version of the
offer. The new offer version has all the offer data values and the list of
approvers carried over from the last version. Users can switch back and forth
between different offer versions if they are the creator or as an approver, that
version was shared with them for approval. Users can also choose to **delete a
specific draft offer version** to go back to the previous state.

When the offer is saved and approved and ready to be sent to the candidate, the
offer creator can click **Send to candidate**.

    will be sent to the candidate.

2.  You can also specify an offer expiration date at this point. Candidates are
    expected to accept or decline the offer before the end of expiration date.
    They will be given a reminder 48 hours before the offer expires.
