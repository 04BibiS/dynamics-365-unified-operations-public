a service for developers and non-technical users to build custom business apps
for mobile devices, tablets, and the web, without writing code. PowerApps
developed by you, your organization, or the broader ecosystem can then be
embedded in the Talent client to augment the product's functionality. For
example, you might build a PowerApp to supplement Talent with information
retrieved from another system.
