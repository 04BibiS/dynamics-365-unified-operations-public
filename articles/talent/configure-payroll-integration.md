# Configure your payroll integration

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

The integration between Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent, Ceridian Dayforce
relies on several configuration steps that are described in this topic. You must
configure the integration in both Talent and Dayforce before processing a pay
run.

When you use a service, such as Ceridian Dayforce, to complete pay runs, you
must enable the integration in Talent. The integration requires certain data
from Talent, so you’ll must also verify that data that’s mapped to Dayforce is
configured in Talent in a manner that supports the integration. The integration
uses the following broad categories of data:

-   Human resources data

-   Compensation data

-   Payroll data, including pay cycle, pay periods, and earning codes

-   Worker data

This topic lists the steps to follow to enable the integration and explains the
types of data and the configuration details that the integration requires.

Enable integration
==================

Within Talent, the integration will need to be enabled and you’ll need to enter
the configuration information to connect to Ceridian Dayforce. If you also want
the resulting general ledger transaction to be imported into Finance and
Operations, you’ll need to set up an Azure Storage Account and enter the
connection string within Finance and Operations.

To turn on the integration within Talent, follow these steps:

1.  On the **System Administration** page, click **Integration configuration.**

2.  Enter the **secure FTP endpoint** and **secure FTP folder path.**

3.  Enter the **user name** and **password** that will access the secure FTP
    endpoint and folder path.

4.  Test the connection if necessary and select **Yes** to **Enable payroll
    integration**.

When the integration is turned on, the data export package and files will be
created, and the frequency specified. You can change this frequency as needed.

For more information about Azure Storage Accounts and Azure Storage Connection
Strings, refer to the following Azure documentation:

[Azure Storage Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-create-storage-account?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json)

[Azure Storage Connection Strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string)

Configure your data 
====================

To process payroll, human resource data needs to be configured in Dynamics 365
for Talent. Organizational data such as jobs and positions, along with benefits
and compensation information, needs to be set up. This information provides the
employment, pay and deduction information required to generate employees’ pay.

Human resource data
-------------------

### Benefits 

Human resources provides tools to set up and maintain benefits, deductions, and
workers' compensation plans that an organization offers or processes for its
workers.

When creating benefits, keep in mind the following data and configurations used
within Dayforce.

#### Benefit plan

-   Plan (required)

-   Type (required)

-   Payroll impact (required)

-   Recover arrears

-   Deduction method

-   Deduction priority

-   Limit period

-   Limit amount

#### Benefit

-   Plan (required)

-   Type (required)

-   Option (required)

-   Benefit ID (required)

-   Frequency

-   Basis

-   Amount or rate

-   Earning code

#### Frequencies supported 

-   Weekly

-   Bi-weekly

-   Semi-monthly

-   Monthly

#### Basis supported 

-   Fixed amount

-   Percent of earnings

-   Productive hours

Dayforce creates the following deductions based on the payroll impact defined on
the benefit plan:

| **Selected in Talent**     | **Result in Dayforce**                       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| None                       | No deduction is created                      |
| Deduction only             | Employee deduction is created                |
| Contribution only          | Employer deduction is created                |
| Deduction and contribution | Employee and employer deductions are created |

### Compensation 

Compensation management is used to control the delivery of base pay and awards.
An employee's fixed base pay and merit increases are controlled through fixed
compensation plans. The payment of incentive pay, such as bonus payments,
performance awards, stock options, and grants, as well as one-time awards, are
controlled through variable compensation plans.

Compensation information is used by Dayforce to calculate an employee’s hourly
or annual rate. Fixed compensation plans and pay rate conversions are required.
Employees must be associated with a fixed compensation plan.

Compensation plans

### Jobs 

A job is a collection of tasks and responsibilities that are required of a
person who performs a job.

[Define new jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/hr/tasks/define-new-jobs)

Positions

A position is an individual instance of a job. For example, the position, “Sales
manager (East),” is one of the positions that is associated with the job, “Sales
manager.” A position exists in a department and can have only one worker
associated with it.

Keep the following data and configuration in mind when setting up positions.

-   Position (required)

-   Description (required)

-   Job (required)

-   Department (required)

-   Position type (required)

-   Full-time equivalent

-   Annual regular hours (required)

-   Paid by legal entity (required)

-   Pay cycle (required)

-   Default financial dimension – Cost center (required)

-   Worker assignment – Worker, assignment start, assignment end, reason code

If multiple positions are in the same department and associated with the same
job, it will be consolidated into a single position in Dayforce.

[Set up positions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/hr/tasks/set-up-positions)

### Departments

A department is an operating unit that represents a category or functional area
of an organization. A department is responsible for a specific area of the
organization, such as sales, accounting, or human resources. You can use
departments to report on functional areas. Departments might have profit and
loss responsibility.

[Create a department and associate it with the department hierarchy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/create-department-add-department-hierarchy)

[Define new departments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/hr/tasks/define-new-departments)

### Pay cycles and pay periods

A pay cycle determines how often payroll is run and on what specific days
workers are paid. For example, a pay cycle might be monthly, and employees might
be paid on the last day of the month, or it might be weekly and employees might
be paid on the Tuesday following the end of the pay period. Pay cycles are
assigned to positions to control when workers in those positions are paid.

After you create pay cycles, you can generate pay periods for each cycle. Each
pay period includes a default payment date that is based on information that you
provide. However, you can modify the default payment date in a pay period to
allow for exceptions, such as when the payment date falls on a holiday.

The following information is used in Dayforce.

-   Pay cycle (required)

-   Pay cycle frequency (required)

-   Period start date (first pay period required)

-   Default payment date (first pay period required)

This information is integrated with Dayforce as pay groups and will be separated
by country for each pay cycle. At least one pay period is required to be
generated prior to integration. Dayforce will generate pay group calendars and
payment dates based on first pay period start date and default payment date
setup in Talent.

### Earning codes

Earning codes uniquely identify every type of earnings that workers receive. The
codes various parameters that relate to earnings, such as accounting rules, tax
laws, reporting requirements, and gross up capability.

The following information is used in Dayforce.

-   Earning Code (required)

-   Description

-   Unit of measure

-   Productive

Worker data

### Employment details

Employment detail history will be used as key information to derive employee’s
hire, termination and rehire status in Dayforce. Dayforce only supports one
active employment record at a given time.

-   Employment start date (required)
-   Employment end date
-   Start date
-   Adjusted start date
-   Termination date (required upon termination)
-   Termination reason (required upon termination)

Employee’s key dates are derived using the following:

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Most recent hire date | Employment start of current non-terminated employment history record                                |
| Termination date      | Termination date of current non-terminated employment history record                                |
| Start date            | Adjusted start date, start date or employment start of current non-active employment history record |
| Original hire date    | Employment start of earliest employment history record                                              |

### Terms of employment

-   Terms of employment (required)
-   Effective (required)
-   Expiration

### Compensation

Each employee must have a fixed compensation plan associated with their primary
position throughout an employment period. This starts from the date they were
hired (or employment start date) until termination.

-   Effective Date (required)
-   Expiration date
-   Pay Rate (required)
-   Pay Rate Conversions (required)
-   Annual equivalent (required)
-   Hourly equivalent (required)

If an hourly employee has multiple positions, the primary position’s fixed
compensation is imported into Dayforce as the employee level base rate/salary.
For non-primary positions, the hourly rate is saved to its respective position
in Dayforce.

If a salaried employee has multiple positions, the cumulative hour rate and
annual salary across all active positions is derived and used as the employee
level base rate/salary.

### Identification numbers

#### Social security identifier 

Employees are required to have one primary identifier. This needs to be “SSN”
identification type which will be automatically derived as their Social Security
identifier in Dayforce required for hire.

-   Primary (required)
-   Identification Type = “SSN”
-   Issued Date
-   Expiration Date

Employees can declare multiple identification numbers with Identification Type
equivalent to “SSN”. Only the record marked as Primary will be integrated into
Dayforce, regardless of whether the number is active or expired.

#### Passport number

Employees may declare Passport information with identification type equivalent
to “Passport”. This information will be integrated to Dayforce as part of an
employee’s Mexico-specific information.

-   Identification Type = “Passport”
-   Issued Date
-   Expiration Date

Employees can declare multiple identification numbers with Identification Type
equivalent to “Passport”. In such case, only current active Passport will be
integrated to Dayforce. In cases where all Passport entries are expired, the
passport issued most recently will be integrated into Dayforce.

### Bank accounts and disbursements

Employees choosing to be paid via bank account transfers need to have valid bank
account information entered.

| **Talent**                     | **Dayforce**                                                                                    |
