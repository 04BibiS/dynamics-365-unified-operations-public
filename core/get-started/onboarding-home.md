# Before you buy 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

New to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition? We've put together step-by-step guidance whether you’re still evaluating Finance and Operations or ready to make a purchase.

## Step one:  Try out Finance and Operations in a free 7-day trial
You can start a 7-day trial of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations through a simple email signup. The trial version of Finance and Operations includes a Getting started guide that provides a step-by-step task guide, which allows you to view specific scenarios in action. The product is available to explore and exercise scenarios. Demo data is included to ease the use of the product and to make the experience more meaningful. A reminder email will be sent 3 days prior to the trial expiration. A buy experience can be initiated at that time to complete the purchase. Get details at www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations.

> [!NOTE] 
> Support included for Trial is the same as what customers receive when purchasing Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online services. Premium level support options are not available for purchase during the trial period.

## Buy and manage a subscription
With Dynamics 365, you can evolve your business on your terms. Start with just what you need to run your business. For example, you might want to start with the Finance and Operations app or the Dynamics 365 for Customer Service app, and then add more apps as your needs change.

### Task recordings and Task guides

Task Recorder is a Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations tool that you can use to record the actions that you take in the user interface (UI). When you create a *task recording*, all events that are executed against the server are recorded as you perform them in the UI. These events include adding values, changing settings, and removing data. A *task guide* is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task recording. You can open (or *play*) a task guide from the Help system.
