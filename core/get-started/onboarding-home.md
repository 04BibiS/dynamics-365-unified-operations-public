# Before you buy 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

New to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition? We've put together step-by-step guidance whether you’re still evaluating Finance and Operations or ready to make a purchase.

## Step one:  Try out Finance and Operations in a free 7-day trial
You can start a 7-day trial of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations through a simple email signup. The trial version of Finance and Operations includes a Getting started guide that provides a step-by-step task guide, which allows you to view specific scenarios in action. The product is available to explore and exercise scenarios. Demo data is included to ease the use of the product and to make the experience more meaningful. A reminder email will be sent 3 days prior to the trial expiration. A buy experience can be initiated at that time to complete the purchase. Get details at [www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations](www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations).

## Step two: Buy and manage a subscription
With Dynamics 365, you can evolve your business on your terms. Start with just what you need to run your business. For example, you might want to start with the Finance and Operations app or the Dynamics 365 for Customer Service app, and then add more apps as your needs change.
There are four ways to buy a subscription of Dynamics 365:
