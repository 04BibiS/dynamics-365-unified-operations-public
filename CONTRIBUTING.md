# Contributing to Finance and Operations documentation
Welcome! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations documentation.

In this topic you'll find the basic process for adding or updating content that is published on the [Dynamics 365 documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/).

## Code of conduct
This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Markdown, Git, and GitHub
All the topics in this repository use GitHub flavored markdown. Here's a list of resources to help you use Markdown:

* [Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
* [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

If you're unfamiliar with Git, you might want to review some Git terminology in the [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary).

The GitHub UI supports the creation of new files and dragging and dropping images. However, when you work in the UI, managing branches can be confusing so we recommend that you install the tools and learn the commands for creating and managing articles. 

* [Creating files on Github](https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github)
* [Upload files to your repositories](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories)

## Ways to contribute
You can submit updates to the [Dynamics 365 documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/) as follows:

* **Minor changes** - You can easily contribute to technical content in the GitHub user interface. Either find the topic in this repository, or visit the topic on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365, and then click the link in the topic that goes to the GitHub source for the topic.
* **Larger submissions** - If you're making substantial changes to an existing topic, adding or changing images, or contributing a new topic, you need to fork this repository, use GitHub or install your favorite Markdown editor, and learn some git commands.

### Minor changes
If you only need to make textual updates to an existing topic, you can use GitHub's web-based Markdown editor to submit your changes. 

1. Click the Edit button on the page that you want to modify.

2. Click the edit icon in the GitHub version of the topic.

 This opens the GitHub web editor that makes it easy to submit changes.
 
Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repo are covered by the [docs.microsoft.com Terms of Use](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/termsofuse).

### Larger submissions
For the following sorts of work, we strongly recommend that you install and learn to use Git and GitHub tools:

* Making major changes to a topic.
* Creating and publishing a new topic.
* Adding new images or updating images.
* Updating an topic over a period of days without publishing changes each of those days.
* Creating content for a release that has to go out on a certain day at a certain time.

If you submit a pull request with new or significant changes to documentation and code examples, we'll send a comment in GitHub asking you to submit an online Contribution License Agreement (CLA) if you are not an employee of Microsoft. We need you to complete the online form before we can accept your pull request.

#### Template 
Use the /template.md file as a standard Markdown template, with the basic Markdown formatting that you need for a new topic. We suggest that you copy this template to a new file, fill out the metadata as specified in the Metadata section, set the H1 heading above to the title of the topic, and delete the content in the template as you add your own content.

## Permissions

2. Register your GitHub account with the publishing system before you submit your first pull request. To do this, visit https://op-portal-prod.azurewebsites.net/, and click "Sign in with GitHub". The one-time sign-in is all that is needed. 

## DOs and DON'Ts

Here are some guiding rules that you should keep in mind when you're contributing to Finance and Operations documentation.

- **DO** use the [template](./template.md) file as the starting point of your work
- **DO** create a separate branch on your fork before working on topics.
- **DO** follow the [GitHub Flow workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).    
- **DON'T** treat the repo as a general database store. Only store text and art in the repository. 
- **DON'T** check in anything that should not be seen by other people, for example an email address, password, access token, or internal server name. Even if you delete the text from the file, it will remain in the history and can be viewed from there.
