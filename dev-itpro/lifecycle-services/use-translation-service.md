# Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Translation Service User guide

## Alignment
If you have previously translated files, you can create XLIFF TM to recycle the translation for newer version of source files.
Align tool can be accessed by clicking the icon in the DTS project dashboard.
  

Select source and target languages as well as the files to be aligned.  Clicking the Align button will perform the alignment and pops up the download dialog when the result is ready.  You may need to explicitly allow popup on the browser.
 

Here are some tips to create a quality XLIFF TM.  Alignment tool is smart enough to alleviate some of these issues, but it is easier to troubleshoot when you see the unexpected results in the output:
1.	Make sure the source and target files have same number of resources
2.	Make sure the resources are in the same order in source and target files
3.	Make sure there is no empty strings.  The screenshots below show examples of empty strings from source and translation

Here is an example of empty strings in the source files. 
 

These empty strings are inherited into the XLIFF TM.  ‘Rebate’ with empty target string is likely to be translated to empty string if this XLIFF TM is used.
 

It is a good practice to review the aligned XLIFF before using it as TM.  Reviewed TUs should be marked as ‘Final’ or ‘Signed off’ so that they won’t be confused with not-yet-reviewed translations.


## Creating a translation request

In the main dashboard, click ‘Add’ icon to start creating the new translation request.
 

Fill out the necessary fields for the request.

  +	**Request name** – Add name to your request to easily identify it.
  +	**Product name** – Product name that your source files are used for. 
  +	**Product version** – Version of Product.
  +	**Target country/region** – Select a country/region to use the translation service for.
  +	**Translation source language** – Select a language that source files are written in.
  +	**Translation target language** – Select a language to translate into.

When selecting the languages, you will notice that there are some language names in **bold**.  Microsoft ships those languages, hence there are Microsoft trained MT system available.
Please note that you will have to select **English – United States** for either source or target language to take advantage of Microsoft trained MT system.

For example:

Source language |	Target language |	MT system to be used
--- | --- | ---
English – United States |	Japanese	| Microsoft trained MT system
Japanese |	English – United States	| Microsoft trained MT system
German	| Japanese	| Generic MT system*

*Unless the user provides XLIFF TM with more than 10,000 TUs.
 
Click Create and confirming the information will complete the creation of the request, and take you to the next step, ‘Upload’.


## Uploading the files
Clicking the plus sign will fly out the File upload pane.  You can upload a single zip file for each of two file types: Source zip file and XLIF TM zip file.
 

### Source zip file
As the name implies, source zip file is the zip file that contains all the source files you wish to translate in the request.  Different file types can be included as long as they are the supported file types for the product.  Please refer to the Supported products for the supported file types.


### XLIFF TM zip file (Optional)
If you have XLIFF files from the previous DTS request, or used Alignment tool to create XLIFF TM, you can zip the XLIFF files and upload here.  Strings that match are recycled into the new source files so that you can keep the consistency between the product versions.  T detail about the XLIFF is explained in the XLIFF TM section

In addition to the recycle, DTS will use XLIFF TM to create a customized MT system based on these rules:

  + Either source or target language is Microsoft’s GA language, AND the other language is **English- United States**.
  +	Either source or target language is **NOT** Microsoft’s GA language, AND XLIFF TM contains more than 10,000 translation units(TUs).

DTS will use generic MT system after the recycle if:

  +	Either source or target language is **NOT** Microsoft’s GA language, AND XLIFF TM contains less than 10,000 translation units(TUs).  This is due to the requirement of MT Hub.
  

When necessary files are uploaded, click ‘Submit’ for the DTS to start the translation process.

Here is a rough estimate on how long the process will take.  Please note that the process time depends on the number of requests in the queue and wordcount of the submitted files.

  +	Request without XLIFF TM : As short as few minutes (depends on the file size.)

  +	Request with XLIFF TM:

     + Creating a custom MT system: 2~3 days
     + Using generic MT system: As short as few minutes (depends on the file size.)


## Translation complete
When the translation is complete, you will receive an email notification. The result is available in the Request output section in the DTS. 

 

When translation is complete two types of files are provided.  

  + File for translation review  
    You can download the XLIFF file and edit to improve the translation in this multilingual file.  

  + Translated file in native format  
    Download this file if you have no intention to edit the translation.

We encourage you to post-edit the translations in the provided XLIFF file, or at least review them to make sure the translation output is up to your product’s standard.  


## Editing the translation in XLIFF

The XLIFF file will look similar to this when opened in the Multilingual Editor.
 


Note that there are red and yellow circles towards the beginning of each line indicating the state of the translation.  These states are automatically assigned by the DTS depending of where the translation came from.

+	Red circle  
  The text is machine translated. DTS assigns the state as ‘Needs Review’*

+	Yellow, Green/Yellow, Green circle  
  The text is recycled. DTS inherited the state from the XLIFF TM used in the request.

*Please note that the state value shown may be slightly different depending on the XLIFF editor.

You may apply the filter and only display the ‘Needs Review’ strings to verify the translation.  
 
Reviewed string should be marked as “Translated”, “Final”, or "Signed off” so that they can be used for recycling. **Translations that are marked as “Needs Review” will not be included for recycling.**

## Regenerate
When you finish reviewing the translation, you will need to regenerate the output files based on the change you made in the XLIFF files.  

 

Clicking the Regenerate button will take you to the Regenerate pane where you can upload the edited XLIFF files.  Please make sure to zip the files before uploading.

 

Once Upload button is clicked, DTS will ask you to confirm the upload.  DTS will regenerate the new output immediately after the confirmation.

 

You can repeat this regenerate process as many time as necessary.

## XLIFF TM
DTS uses bi-lingual XLIFF format to store source and target language pairs.  XLIFF format is based on the XML; therefore, you can open it with any text editor.  However, we recommend using one of the XLIFF editors that are specifically designed to work with this format.  We use Multilingual Editor available as a part of Multilingual App Toolkit(MAT) since it is one of the free options available.

In DTS, you can obtain XLIFF TM in two different ways.

+	By running alignment tool  
  When you have previously translated files along with corresponding source files, you can use alignment tool to create XLIFF TM.  For details, please refer to the Alignment section

+	By completing the translation request  
  When translation request is complete, DTS will provide user XLIFF TMs as well as the translated files in the source format.

XLIFF files contain series of translation units(TUs) that are extracted from the source files.  Here is an example of a translation unit:

    <trans-unit id="PRO39" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
    <source>Rebate</source>
    <target state="translated" state-qualifier="exact-match">リベート</target>
    </trans-unit>

Same translation unit looks like in the Multilingual Editor (blue highlighted):
 


## State
Each translation in the XLIFF file is associated with the state value.  DTS assigns these values to each translation depending on how the string is translated.
When XLIFF TM is created with alignment tool, all translations are marked as ‘Translated’.  This is because the aligned TUs are produced from known good translations (i.e. previous product version).

However, when the XLIFF files are generated as results of the translation request, there are two types of states that may be used:

+	Needs Review  
  The string has been machine translated.

+	Translated, Final, or Signed off  
  These strings have been recycled. The states were inherited from the XLIFF TM.

This is convenient as you can focus on the “Needs Review” strings when post editing.  Reviewed string should be marked as “Translated”, “Final”, or "Signed off” so that they can be used for recycling. **Translations that are marked as “Needs Review” will not be included for recycling.**

Inherited state values for recycled strings are also convenient, as you will never have to review the same string (with identical ID) again.


## Glossary
### *XLIFF*
XLIFF is an XML-based format created to standardize the way localizable data are passed between tools during a localization process and a common format for CAT tool files.

### *Microsoft’s GA languages*
General availability of the language versions.  The list of languages depends on the product.

### *TU*
Translation unit.  The translation unit typically contains source string, translation, state, state qualifier, and note.
