# Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Translaion Service - Overview

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Translation Service (DTS) is designed to enhance the partners and ISVs translation experience of their solutions or when adding a new language for [supported Dynamics products](./translation-service-overview.md#supported-products).  

DTS uses custom trained machine translation (MT) system for [Microsoft’s GA languages](./use-translation-service.md#Glossary) to maximize the quality of translation output. DTS also supports translation recycling from Dynamics and/or Partners/ISVs linguistic assets so identical strings are translated once and consistently. 

Here is a high-level view of how the service works:

## Recycling of Partners/ISVs existing translations
Partners/ISVs linguistic assets recycling is only enabled when they upload them in XLIFF translation memory (TM) zip file format. Please refer to the [XLIFF TM zip file](./use-translation-service.md#XLIFF-TM) section for more details. 

## Custom trained MT system
DTS uses Microsoft Translator Hub (MT Hub) from Microsoft Research to customize the MT system for the Dynamics products.
The use of custom trained MT system is limited to Microsoft’s Dynamics GA languages unless partners/ISVs upload XLIFF TMs that contain more than 10,000 translation units (TUs). In such case, DTS will create a custom trained MT specific to the request. 

## Supported products
DTS currently supports the following product versions.
