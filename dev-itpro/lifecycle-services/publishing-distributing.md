# Distribute a BPM library

This will make the library available to all users that are part of your organization, which would be all users who sign in to LCS using your organization&#39;s domain. For example, all users with a @contoso.com account.

  1. Ask the customer to invite you to their project.
  2. Sign in to the customer&#39;s LCS project using your organization&#39;s account.
  3. Go to the **Business process libraries** page and copy the desired library from the **Corporate libraries** pane to the customer&#39;s project.
