## Distribute a BPM library

When you distribute a BPM library, the library will be available to all of the users that are a part of your organization, which would be all users who sign in to LCS using your organization's domain. For example, all users with a @contoso.com account.

  1. Ask the customer to invite you to their project.
  2. Sign in to the customer's LCS project using your organization's account.
  3. Go to the **Business process libraries** page and copy the library from the **Corporate libraries** pane to the customer's project.
