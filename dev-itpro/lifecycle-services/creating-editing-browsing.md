3. The new library is now available to users in the current project.
4. Select the library to open it in BPM. Use BPM to build, edit, and browse your library.

## Add a new process

1. Select an existing process in your library.
2. On the toolbar, click **Add process**. Here you can add a process as a child or sibling of the selected process node. This allows you to create a semantic hierarchy of business processes.

3. Enter a name and a description for the process node.
4. Select the industries and countries/regions that this process applies to. Here you can also add keywords and links. Keywords can be used to define categories, work streams, or other metadata. Links (URLs) allow you to reference external sites or documentation.

## Delete a process

## Copy a Global or Corporate library to your project

You can browse a BPM library that is a Global or Corporate library. However, to edit and work with a BPM library, it must be part of your LCS project. Libraries distributed by Microsoft appear under **Global libraries**, while libraries that are published by your organization appear under **Corporate libraries**.

Use this guide to copy a global or corporate library to your project

1. In your LCS project, open the **Business process libraries** page.
2. On the tile of the library that you want to copy, click the ellipsis (â€¦), and then select **Copy**.

## Search a BPM library

You can search for words or phrases in your BPM library. The search functionality searches through business process names and descriptions.

- To search for a _word_, enter the word in the search bar and press **Enter**.
- To search for a _phrase_, use double quotes around the search phrase. For example, enter _technology_ (word) or _&quot;information technology&quot;_ (phrase) in the search bar.
- You can also search for AOT elements that are part of the Dynamics 365 for Operations Task recordings in your library. These are typically form names or menu items names. When you search for an AOT element, prefix it with the $ sign. For example, _$CustTable_.
