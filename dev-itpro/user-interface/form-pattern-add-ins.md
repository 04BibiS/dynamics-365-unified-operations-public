# Form pattern add-ins

The tools for Visual Studio include a number of add-ins that support pattern development. 

## Form statistics add-in
The **Form statistics** add-in provides a summary of the pattern usage for forms. When you access the **Form statistics** add-in from the **Dynamics 365 **menu, it displays statistics for all forms. When you access the add-in from the shortcut menu for a form that is open in the form designer, it displays statistics for that form only.
