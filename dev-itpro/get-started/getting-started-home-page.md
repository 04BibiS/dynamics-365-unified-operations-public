### Task recordings and Task guides

Task Recorder is a DynamicsÂ 365 for Operations tool that you can use to record the actions that you take in the user interface (UI). When you create a *task recording*, all events that are executed against the server are recorded as you perform them in the UI. These events include adding values, changing settings, and removing data. A *Task guide* is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task recording. You can open (or *play*) a task guide from the Help system.
-   [Connecting the help system](work-with-help.md)
-   [Task Recorder in Dynamics 365 for Operations](../user-interface/task-recorder.md)
-   [Create documentation or training using Task recordings](../user-interface/task-recorder.md)
-   [New task guides available (February 2016)](new-task-guides-available-february-2016.md)
