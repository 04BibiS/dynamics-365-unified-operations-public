This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Operations platform update 7. This version was released in May 2017 and has a build number of 7.0.XXXX.XXXX.

## Configuration data projects ##
Using a configuration data project, you can easily export configuration data and move it from one instance to another instance. This feature provides an updated user interface, and the ability to easily manage templates and projects.

## Development tooling - New tabbed workspace pattern ##
A new tabbed workspace form pattern is now available. You can now include tab pages that house embedded Power BI reports. This feature is our first step toward moving away from horizontally-scrolling workspaces.
