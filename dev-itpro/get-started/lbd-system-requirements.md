# System requirements for on-premises environments

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Before you install Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition on-premises, verify that the system you are working with meets or exceeds the minimum network, hardware, and software requirements. 

## Network requirements 
Finance and Operations can operate on networks that use Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Consider the network environment when you plan the system, and use the following guidelines. 

### Network response time 
The following table lists the minimum network requirements for the connection between the Web browser and the Application Object Server (AOS) and the connection between the AOS and the database in an on-premises system. 

| Value         | Web browser to AOS | AOS to database | AOS to Lifecycle Services |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Bandwidth (b) | 50 KBps            | 199 Mbps        |                           |
| Latency       | 250-300 ms         | < 1 ms          |                           |

- Finance and Operations on-premises is designed for networks with latency of 250-300 milliseconds (ms) or less. This is the latency from a browser client to the data center that hosts Finance and Operations. 

- Bandwidth requirements for Finance and Operations on-premises depend on your scenario. Typical scenarios require a bandwidth of more than 50 kilobytes per second (KBps). However, for scenarios that have high payload requirements, such as workspaces or scenarios that involve extensive customization, more bandwidth is recommended. 
In general, Finance and Operations is optimized for the Internet. The number of round trips from a browser client to the data center is very small, and the whole payload is compressed. 

**Warning:** Don’t calculate bandwidth requirements from a client location by multiplying the number of users by the minimum bandwidth requirements. The concurrent usage of a given location is very difficult to calculate. If you are are concerned about bandwidth requirements, use a preview version of Finance and Operations. 

### Local area network (LAN) environments 
There is no Windows Server Remote Desktop requirement to connect to Finance and Operations on-premises but it may be required for servicing operations on the environment. 

### Wide area network (WAN) environments 
There is no Windows Server Remote Desktop requirement to connect to Finance and Operations on-premises but it may be required for servicing operations. 

### Internet connectivity requirements 
Finance and Operations on-premises does not need internet connectivity to operate, however certain features are not available in the offline mode. 

| Browser client           | INTRANET scenario without INTERNET connectivity is a design point for the on-premises deployment option. Some features that require cloud services will not be available. For example, Help and task guide libraries in Lifecycle Services (LCS). |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server                   | The AOS or Service Fabric tier must be able to communicate with LCS. The on-premises client does not need to be connected to the cloud.                                                                        |
| Telemetry                | Telemetry data may be lost if there are interruptions in connectivity. Interruptions in connectivity to LCS do not affect the on-premises application functionality.                                          |
| Lifecycle Services (LCS) | Connectivity to LCS is required for deployment, code deployment, and servicing operations.                                                                                                                    |

## Telemetry data transfer to the cloud 
Most telemetry is stored locally and can be accessed by using the Windows Event Viewer. A small subset of telemetry events are transferred into our telemetry pipeline. 

## Domain requirements 
Consider the following domain requirements when you install Finance and Operations: 
· Computers that run base for Finance and Operations on-premises components must belong to an Active Directory domain. The Active Directory must be configured in native mode. 
**Note:** Retail system requirements are not supported at this time therefore Finance and Operations on-premises does not include retail. 
· Computers that run base Finance and Operations on-premises components must have access to other computers in Active Directory. These computers may be in the same domain or in another trusted domain. 
· The domain controller must run in Windows Server 2016. 

## Hardware requirements 
This section of the document describes the hardware that is required to run Finance and Operations on-premises. 
Based on the system configuration and the applications and features that you decide to use, the actual requirements may vary. Some of the many factors that affect the choice of appropriate hardware for Finance and Operations include: 

· The number of transactions per hour.
· The number of concurrent users. 
· The number of remote connections. 
· The number of locations. 
For more information about the factors to consider, see “How to size and on premise installation”. 

## Minimum infrastructure requirements 
Finance and Operations on-premises utilizes Service Fabric to host the AOS, Batch, Data management, Management reporter, and Orchestrator services. SSRS is not hosted in the Service Fabric cluster. 
Independent of that, SQL Server must be set up in a high availability hadron setup with at least 2 nodes. 

The followign graphic shows the minimum amount of virtual machines allowed:

### Processor and RAM requirements 
The following table lists the number of processors and amount of RAM that are required for server computers. 
**Note:** If other Microsoft software is installed on the same computer, the system must also comply with the hardware requirements for that software. We recommend that you limit other server applications on the same computer as the AOS, to 1 GB of RAM.

| Topology              | Role                                                          | Instances | Cores | Memory(GB) |

|                       | Active directory                                              | 3         | 4     | 16         |

### Storage
- **AOS:** Finance and Operations is utilizing the Azure blob storage to store data including metadata, traces, and documents. The on-premise version will use a SMB 3.0 share and for this. For more information, see [Storage Spaces Direct in Windows Server 2016](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview). 
- **SQL:** Viable options are: 
  •	A highly available SSD setup
  •	A storage area network
  •	Direct attached storage
- **IOPS:** The storage for both data management and SQL Server should have at least 2000 IOPS.

### Virtual Host requirements
There are many different ways to set up virtual hosts and SQL Server. In general, the more physical hardware is utilized the more performance the less physical hardware the easier the maintenance. In all cases, if virtualization is used there should no VM Snapshots being taken.

When setting up the virtual hosts for a Finance and Operations on-premises environment, verify that you have at least three virtual hosts each of which have enough cores to the infrastructure you sized. There are multiple advanced configurations possible where the SQL Server is residing on physical hardware and everything else is virtualized. If SQL Server is virtualized, at a minumum the disk subsystem should be a fast storage area network or equal. In all cases, make sure that the basic virtual host setup is highly available and redundant.

## Software requirements for all server computers 
 The following software must be present on a computer before any Finance and Operations components can be installed:
 
•	Microsoft .NET Framework
•	Service Fabric
 
More information on Service Fabric: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server#download-the-service-fabric-standalone-package
 
### Supported server operating systems
The following table lists the server operating systems that are supported for Finance and Operations components. 

| Operating system                           | Note                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows Server 2016 Datacenter or Standard | These requirements are for the database and the server hosting the Application Object Server. |

### Software requirements for database servers
Regardless of the SQL Server version that you use, the following requirements apply: 
•	Only 64-bit versions of SQL Server are supported. 
•	In a Production environment, we recommend that you install the latest cumulative update for the version of SQL Server that you are using.  
•	Finance and Operations supports Unicode collations that are case-insensitive, accent-sensitive, kana-sensitive, and width-insensitive. The collation must match the Microsoft Windows locale of the computers that are running AOS instances. If you are setting up a new installation, we recommend that you select a Windows collation instead of a SQL Server collation. For more information about how to select a collation for a SQL Server database, see the [SQL Server documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119526). 
 
The following table lists the SQL Server versions that are supported for the Finance and Operations databases. For more information,  see the minimum hardware requirements for [SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx).
