# Features not intended for use with on-premises deployments
The following features are not intended for use in on-premises deployments. There are no plans to implement these features in on-premises deployments.

### SSRS Report Viewer control

web client.

|----------------------------------|--|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | SQL Reporting Services (SSRS) does not support a report viewer control that is compatible with the on-premises web client.      |

| **Modules affected**             | All    |
