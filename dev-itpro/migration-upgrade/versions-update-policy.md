[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic outlines the lifecycle and support policies for the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition online service and the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition on-premises software deployments.

Modern Lifecycle Policy
-----------------------
The Modern Lifecycle Policy covers products and services that are serviced and supported continuously. For more information about this policy, click [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/30881).

The Dynamics 365 for Operations online service and the Dynamics 365 for Operations on-premises software is covered by the Modern Lifecycle Policy. Licensed customers must stay current with updates to the Dynamics 365 for Operations online service or on-premises software in accordance with the following servicing and system requirements:

-   Application versions are supported for three years from the initial date of a major release as specified in Table 1 below; and

-   Platform versions are supported as follows and as further specified in Table 3:

    -   **Critical Fixes:** One year from date Microsoft releases the cloud and on-premises platform version.

    -   **Non-critical Updates:** Customers must update to the most current Dynamics 365 for Operations platform version in order to deploy non-critical updates.

**Note:** Platform versions maintain backward compatibility.

Online Service Update Policies
------------------------------

-   **Dynamics 365 for Operations platform updates** may be initiated by
    Microsoft or by the customer using Lifecycle Services. After the customer
    tests the updates and provides consent, the updates will be rolled out to
    production environments.

-   **Dynamics 365 for Operations application updates** can be initiated by the
    customer using Lifecycle Services.

Before updates are applied to the customer’s production environment, they must
be tested by the customer in a sandbox environment. For details about how the
sandbox environment will be provided, see the [Dynamics 365 lLicensing
gGuide](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AXPlatform/Shared%20Documents/Licensing%20and%20Software%20Terms/Dynamics%20365%20Licensing%20Guide)
(<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/pricing>).

**Important:** To help protect our customers and the online service, Microsoft
may apply critical fixes directly to your Dynamics 365 for Operations
environments. If a critical fix must be applied, Microsoft will notify the
customer of the required downtime window (if any) and apply the fix to the
applicable Dynamics 365 for Operations environment. After fixes are applied,
Microsoft will communicate completion to the customer.

On-premises Software Update Policies
------------------------------------

The customer is in full control of its on-premises deployments and must follow
this policy. The customer is in control of installing the updates in their
on-premise environments. Microsoft will support the Dynamics 365 for Operations
on-premises software through December 31, 2027, at a minimum, but only if the
customer keeps the deployed on-premises software current according to this
policy.

The Dynamics 365 for Operations on-premises software is licensed and supported
under the [Modern Support Lifecycle
Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/447912/announcing-microsoft-modern-lifecycle-policy).
This requires the customer to maintain Software Assurance (“SA”) or the
Enhancement Plan and deploy updates as noted in Table 2 below. Customers who
want to use the Fixed Support Lifecycle Policy (5+5), must downgrade to
Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. If a customer lapses on SA or the Enhancement
Plan, that customer will be eligible only for the perpetual license rights to
Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and must uninstall the Dynamics 365 for Operations
on-premises software.

The initial release of the on-premises software will be based on platform update
8 and Application version 7.2.
