# Troubleshooting guide for package deployment failures
The topic below explains in detail how to troubleshoot issues seen when applying packages on your Tier 1 or Tier 2/3/4/5 environments. For details on how to apply a package refer to the [Apply a deployable package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/apply-deployable-package-system) wiki.

## General troubleshooting/diagnostics

If package application isn't successful, you have two options:

- Click  **Resume**  to retry the operation that failed.

 
Using the logs

1. Download the logs.
2. Unzip the log files.
3. Select the role that a step failed for, such as  **AOS**  or  **BI**.
4. Select the VM where the step failed. This information appears in the  **Machine name**  column in the  **Environment updates**  section.
5. In the logs for the VM, select the folder that corresponds to the step where the issue occurred. The folder name identifies the step that each folder corresponds to. For example, if the issue occurred in the executing a step, select the  **ExecuteRunbook\** \* folder.

For example, if the folder name is ExecuteRunbook-b0c5c413-dae3-4a7a-a0c4-d558614f7e98-1\_I0\_R0, the step number is highlighted and is the number after the globally unique identifier (GUID).



## How To guide for addressing commonly seen failures during package application

### General failures

**Issue 1: S**** ervicing status failed without listing any steps in the &quot;Environment updates&quot; section**

**Description:** This indicates that package being applied is invalid.

- Download logs
- Unzip and navigate to the AOS machine logs
- Verify that &quot;DownloadFilesAndSlipstreamTools-xxx&quot; folder exist
- Verify that &quot;GenerateRunbook-xxx&quot; folder exists
- Click inside GenerateRunbook-xxx folder and open the output type file

If error is found or an exception is found that a file is missing or failed to generate any steps for runbook etc, it&#39;s mainly due to invalid package being uploaded.

**Action** :

 Click **Abort** to abort the current package, upload a new package and start the servicing flow again.

**Issue 2**** : **** Package deployment has failed without any step failures.**

**Description:** Timed-out when downloading the package into the machine. During servicing, there would be few steps that would be done in pre-servicing before running the actual steps in the runbook. As part of the pre-servicing the important step is downloading the package in all the machines. The time to download might vary a bit based on the data center where the environment is residing. If the download doesn&#39;t happen within 30 minutes, it would give up and result as failure in the servicing status.

If It&#39;s been about 30 minutes since the package deployment is initiated, then you are mostly running into the issue. Resume should fix mostly fix the issue.

**Action:**

- Download the logs from the environment page
- Ensure that the package download step has the logs in all the machines with the following folder DownloadFilesAndSlipstreamTools
- Inspect the log files and if you do not see the following is shown at the end of the log file, then package download is not completed and hence the issue.
  - _Completed file download and slipstream successfully_

**Issue 3**** : **** Package deployment has failed without any step failures.**

**Description:** Disk space is not enough to download the package. During servicing, there would be few steps that would be done in pre-servicing before running the actual steps in the runbook. As part of the pre-servicing the important step is downloading the package in all the machines. If there is not enough disk space to download the package, then the servicing would result as a failure. Inspect all the machines and any of the machines servicing drive is full then you are running into this issue.

         Manually clean up old package deployment folder and free up disk space.

Please note that &quot;resume&quot; would not help here and need manual intervention before you can resume.

- Download the logs from the environment page
- Ensure that the package download step has the logs in all the machines with the following folder DownloadFilesAndSlipstreamTools
- Inspect the log files and if you see the download has failed due to disk space issue, proceed with the how to fix section.

**Action:**

- On all types of topologies, as part of automated cleanup we delete deployablepackages older than 30 days located at %ServiceVolume%\DeployablePackages as well as servicing related logs older than 30 days located usually at C:\Dynamics.
- On Dev/Onebox machines, however, there is a flexibility of customizing number of retention days and minimum disk space of ServiceVolume drive and Logs drive.
- Under registry key **HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Dynamics\Deployment** , we can create following keys to customize when should the cleanup happen and the automated cleanup task will consider these numbers

**CutoffDaysForCleanup** -&gt; number of days old packages/logs that should be retained. - Default value is 30

**CutoffDiskSpaceLimitForPackages** -&gt; (in GB) minimum free disk space of the service volume drive where packages folder is located. In the following case if disk space is &lt;200 GB cleanup task will remove the packages based on number of days.

**CutoffDiskSpaceLimitForLogs** -&gt; (in GB) minimum free disk space of the system drive where logs folder is located. In the following case if disk space is &lt;100 GB cleanup task will remove the servicing related based on number of days.

**Issue 4: Step has failed with errors.**

**Description:**

This indicates that one of the following might be the reasons

- Package has issues due to customizations or missing dependencies
- Servicing scripts has an issue
- Random failure during the step execution

Steps:

- Download logs
- Navigate to the step logs
- Open the output file for the step and see if there any errors.
- If there any additional log files available, please inspect the logs for any errors.



**Action 1** :

Download the logs

Click &quot; **Rerun step**&quot; to re-try the failed step

If it fails again with the same issue

**Action 2** :

- Look into the logs to dig in more
- If you notice that there is an issue with the customizations, abort this package and re-try with the new package.
- Check if there a fix available for the issue in the issue search.
- If you see the following step failure, GlobalUpdate script for service model: AOSService, this indicates that either DBSync or Report deployment might have failed.
- Look for DBSync.err file to see what the errors are and inspect DBSync.log file. For specific failures during DB Sync step, look at the **Common DB Sync Failures** section.



**Issue 5: Deployment status is showing &quot;Servicing&quot; whereas the servicing status is in &quot;Failed state&quot;**

**Description:**

There is a re-try mechanism in-built to retry multiple times before it gives up especially the preparation step failures such as

1. Download the package into the machines
2. Slipstream the servicing package
3. Generate runbook

**Action** : You can download the logs and see what the error is and start looking into it, before it finishes all the re-tries. If the in-built retry mechanism failed to go beyond the preparation stage after all re-tries. Please open a ticket for Microsoft team to investigate further, once you see the status as &quot;Failed&quot; and it&#39;s not due to invalid package issue.

**Issue 6: After the package deployment is done, failed to launch the dashboard**

**Description:**

This indicates that there might be a run-time error when starting the AOS.

1. Launch event viewer
2. Navigate to &quot;Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Dynamics &gt; Ax-SystemRuntime &gt; Operational

Filter by errors and see if there are any errors and investigate.


**Common DB Sync Failures**

If you see the following step failure, **GlobalUpdate script for service model: AOSService** , it could be a Db Sync issue. Look for DBSync.err file to see what the errors are and inspect DBSync.log file.

Steps:

1. Download logs
2. Navigate to the step logs
3. Open the output file for the step and see if there any errors.
4. If there any additional log files available, please inspect the logs for any errors.
5. Below table shows commonly seen failures and the corresponding action to take. The Issue column shows the error you will see in the dbsync.err file. The % can be replaced with the metadata name of the table, field, index, etc.
