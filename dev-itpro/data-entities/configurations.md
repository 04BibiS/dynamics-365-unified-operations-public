# Copy configuration data to another company

Overview
--------

Configurations are used to manage the movement of company configuration
data between instances of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. The
feature supports the following scenarios:

-   Export configurations, where you can create configurations of
    entities and use the data management framework to export it

-   Import configurations, where you can upload a
    configuration package and use the data management
    framework to import it

Configurations are created using the data import and export projects
that you can access from the data management workspace. The import and export pages allow
you to add and remove the entities that you need to manage the movement
of company and shared data. Once you create the list of entities in your
configuration, you can export or import the configuration using the data
management framework for processing. You can export packages locally and move them
to another instance for import. 

Configuration templates are a predefined list of entities for each
module area that can be used in a data project. You can create, view and
modify these templates using the template page in the data management
workspace.

We are working on additional capabilities for this feature and more integration 
with LCS. We will update this document as those capabilities are available.

Preparing data management for configurations
--------------------------------------------

### Standard and enhanced views

The data management workspace, the template page, and the import/export
pages have been enhanced to better support configurations. These pages
are still delivered in the standard view to provide consistency with our
prior releases. However, if you would like to change the system default to the enhanced
view, you can select the Framework parameters tile on the data
management workspace and change the view default from standard to
enhanced for all users and legal entities.

The system default view settings can also be changed to save settings for each user per each legal entity.
If you use that setting, you must switch to the Enhanced
view menu button on each page for configurations.

### Default data sources file extensions

The template page and import/export page allows you to add entities
by selecting a file that was created by the data management framework. To use
this feature, we have populated some default file extensions with the
data sources that are available to you. If you have additional file
extensions that you want to use, you must update your data sources with
a default file extension that will be used as the target data format.

Use the Configure data sources tile on the data management workspace to
open the data sources page. Add a default file extension to the
appropriate data source. For example, we have added the following
defaults:

-   XLSX for the Excel data source

-   ZIP for the package data source

-   XML for the XML data source

-   CSV for the comma separated values data source

-   TXT for the delimited data source

### Templates for configurations

Predefined templates have been created that will help you create a configuration. 
The templates are sequenced so that the data generated by the entities
will be processed in the correct sequence. The
predefined templates are also designed to maintain the correct sequence when
more than one templates is added to the same data project. See the section on sequencing philosophy for more
information. The templates will be available starting in the spring release of 2017.

Using the data management workspace
-----------------------------------

The data management workspace provides access
to key tasks for data management while providing information on projects
and project execution tasks. For configurations, you should be using the
enhanced view, which you can enable using the enhanced view button. If
your system default in the framework parameters has been changed to
enhanced, that view will open by default.

Use the Import or Export tile to create a project. 
When you return to the workspace, your project will appear in the Data projects list.
Each project is displayed with the type of configuration (import or export) and a
project category (project, configuration, integration, and other). Use
the selections to the left of the grid to filter by the appropriate
project. 

To open a project, select the project and click on load project
to launch the import or export form. Use the Delete button to delete the selected projects. You can also download the project
definitions with the download button.

Use Job history to find more details about the projects that you have
executed. Use the data range filters to filter by the dates that data projects were executed. You can view the execution
details by selecting a job and clicking on the execution details menu.
For export tasks, you can download the data from the workspace using the
download page button.

Export a configuration
----------------------

The data management workspace is your hub for managing configuration
data projects and for exporting data packages. To build a configuration, you
need to define a data project and export the information represented by
entities.

The process for creating configurations is as follows:

1)  Open the data management workspace and switch to the Enhanced view (if you are still using the standard view).

2)  Select the Export tile in the data management workspace.

3)  Select New to create the configuration project and add an ID and
    name that represents the configuration

4)  Select the data project operation type (Export) and project category
    (Configuration).

5)  Now add the entities that represent the information that you want to
    export. You can add entities using several methods:

    a.  Add entity – enter the first part of name of the entity until it
        appears in the lookup.

    b.  Add multiple – enter any part of the entity name, use the lookup
        for application module, enter any part of the tag name, and/or
        use the lookup for the entity category to show a list of
        entities. Tab off the lookup field to activate the filter. Select the entities in the grid that you want to add

    c.  Add file – browse to a file that has a name that matches an
        entity and a file extension that matches the file extensions that were added in the data sources.

    d.  Add template – select from a list of templates that you have
        loaded into your instance 

6)  Select a target data format. The system remembers that last data
    format that you selected or, if you select a file, it will default
    the data format to the data source that matches the file extension. 
    Note that composite entities require an XML format.

7)  Click on the Add button and the entities will be added to
    your data project. If you load a template and there is already an
    existing entity in the project that matches an entity in the
    template, the entity will be replaced by the enity in the template that
    you loaded. Some templates are very large and it may take a few seconds to load them.

8)  Use Remove entity to remove one or more selected entities

You are ready to export a configuration. However, you may want to use
some additional features to control the export process:

1)  Organize your list by using the Sort by button to reorder your
    entities by unit, level and sequence

2)  If want to change the execution sequence of any of the entities,
    you can edit the unit, level, or sequence manually or you can use the Resequence
    button to update any entities that you have selected. You must
    select more than one entity for the Resequence button to appear. You
    can change the unit, level and sequence individually or enable
    multiple changes and do them all at once. If you want the unit,
    level or sequence to remain unchanged when change multiple parts of
    the sequence, set the increment to zero

3)  Add filters to the entity with the Filter icon. The icon will change when 
    you add a filter. The data will be
    filtered before it is exported. If you have added a template and the template 
    included filters, those filters will be added to your project. You can still modify
    or remove them if needed.

4)  If necessary, change the entity mappings using the View map icon. If you have added a template and the template 
    included mapping changes, those changes will be applied to your project. You can still modify
    them if needed.

5)  Use the check box in the Disable column to temporarily stop the
    entity from being used when exporting a data project

6)  Use the Open in Excel button to open the contents of the grid in an
    Excel spreadsheet. Modify the entities as needed and use Publish to
    upload the changes back into Dynamics 365 for Finance and
    Operations.

Now that you have completed your configuration, use the export button to
start the export. You can monitor your results on the execution details
page that is displayed. 

When the export is completed, perform the following tasks:

-   Use the Download button on the export page to download the
    configuration settings.

-   Use the Download package button on the data management workspace or
    on the execution details form to download the configuration settings
    and the data that was exported.

Setup considerations for certain entities used to export configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several entities that require some additional steps when you
are doing configurations. Please follow these recommendations as you build 
your configurations. We will continue to eliminate additional 
steps as we improve the configuration feature.

### Using special purpose entities
The following entities require special handling when used in configurations: 

| Area                           | Entity                                 | Action to take                                            |  
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| System setup                   | Organization hierarchy - published     | There is one entity for exporting hierarchies (Organization hierarchy - published) and a different one for importing them (Organization hierarchy). Both entities are currently in the template at this time. After exporting the package, copy the data from the Organization hierarchy - published file to the Organization hierarchy file. When you import the package, disable the Organization hierarchy - published entity.  |
| GL Shared                      | Account structures active group        | This is a composite entity that will export and import only the active account structures. If you use any other account structure entities, the active account structures will be changed to draft and you will need to activate them before they can be used. |
|                                | Advanced rule structures active group  | Used in combination with account structures active group entity, this composite entity will export and import only the active advanced rule structures active. If you use any other advanced rule structures entities, the advanced rule structures will be changed to draft and you will need to activate them before they can be used. |
|                                | Financial dimension values             | All values, including custom values, will be exported. Remove the custom values before importing them. If you leave them in the package, they will not import. However, the custom values will be populated later when you import the data that backs the custom dimension. |
| Workflow                       | Workflow version                       | Change the owner for every record in the package data to Admin unless the users in the workflow are already imported |  
|                                | Workflow expression                    | Some workflow expressions may be too long for an Excel cell. Use XML as the export format instead of Excel |  
| Tax                            | Sales tax parameters                   | The default value for the marginal base calculations method is "Total" for sales tax parameters. The Ledger Parameters entity does not set that value. However, some tax codes use a marginal base of "Line", which will fail validation. A new entity called Sales tax parameters preset entity was created to allow you to import the marginal base calculation method first so you can then import tax codes | 
| Accounts receivable            | Customers                              | The Customers entity was designed for use with Odata scenarios. For configurations, use the Customer definitions entity and the Customer details entity. The Customer definitions entities allows you to import the basic information about a customer, enabling entities that require a customer to have that information earlier in the import process. The Customer details entity contains additional information about a customer that you can add after parameters and reference data has been set up. |
| Inventory management           | Warehouse locations                    | Some warehouses locations require a Location profile ID.   Location profile ids require a Location format. This information must be imported before the warehouse location  | 
| Product information management | Products                               | The Products and Released Products entities should be used for configurations. The Product master and Released product master entities should be used for Odata scenarios |
|                                | Product document attachments           | For Product document attachments and Released product document attachments, you must never skip staging because additional steps are performed in the staging environment. You must use a data package for export and for import  because the export file needs to be accompanied by a resources folder with the attechments. The entities support images, documents, notes, and links. When you export, you will see an image file with a name that looks like a GUID. It is a valid data package needed to complete the import |
|                                | Product attribute values               | Product attribute values are assigned only when a user opens up the Attribute values page from the Products details page. At this time, you cannot import the values at this time unless this step was performed in the golden build. |
| Procurement                    | Vendor catalog                         | Please refer to the discussion for importing vendor catalogs in the Supply Chain Management blog https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2016/05/25/vendor-catalogs-in-dynamics-ax/  |


### Remove the mapping for specific fields
A golden build may not have customer-specific fields set up. These fields should be unmapped to ensure that the import works. For example, workers are stored in many tables but they may not be set up in a golden build. 

The following entities may need to be unmapped:

| Area                           | Entity                                 | Action to take                                            |  
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| System setup                   | Operating unit                         | Unmap ManagerPersonnelNumber unless you have imported workers |
|                                | User information                       | Apply a filter where the ID is not equal to Admin. Unmap PersonName because there is no mapping to the directory. |
| Accounts payable               | Vendors                                | Unmap purchase site and warehouse unless they are set up. Unmap the 1099 box id and 1099 type unless you have opened the 1099 form. Unmap the vendor bank acccount ID. The vendor bank account entity will set up the link to the bank account when it is imported |
| Accounts receivable            | Customer details                       | Unmap EmployeeResponsibleNumber unless workers have been imported. Unmap CollectionsContactPersonID unless workers and their contact information has been imported |
| Inventory management           | Warehouse current postal address       | Unmap the Picking store area and Input store area unless Retail information has been imported | 
| Product information management | Products                               | Unmap NMFCCode and STCCCode. There are no entities available for those codes at this time |
|                                | Released products                      | Unmap project category, default product color, default configuration, default product size, and default product style. This entity is self-referencing and has not yet been updated to load these fields in a single pass |
|                                | Period template                        | The Period template entity is a shared entity. It can be filtered by Legal entity but the Period template lines entity does not have a Legal entity field. If you want to import a single legal entity, you can filter the period template. However, at this time, you must remove the period template lines that are not related to that legal entity |
|                                | Item coverage group                    | Unmap Period template ID unless they were already imported |
| Procurement                    | Vendors                                | Unmap purchase site and warehouse unless they are set up. Unmap the 1099 box id and 1099 type unless you have opened the 1099 form. Unmap the vendor bank acccount ID. The vendor bank account entity will set up the link to the bank account in the vendor record when it is imported |
| Sales and marketing            | Leads                                  | Unmap LeadOpeningPersonnelNumber, LeadClosingPersonnelNumber, LeadResponsiblePersonnelNumber unless workers have been imported |


### Golden builds with multiple legal entities
The templates can be used to export data from any company in your golden build. When you export both shared data and
company data, the templates will export the shared data for all legal entities and then export the data for the legal
entity that you are currently using. You can then switch companies and export the company data for additional legal entities 
by using projects that do not included the shared entities. 

If you are exporting from a golden build that has multiple legal entities in it 
but you only want to import the data from one of those legal entities, you will need 
to apply a filter on the legal entity fields to export the only the data that you need for that legal entity. 
This filter must remove all data for other legal entities except the one that you want.
In some cases, you will need to take some additional steps to clean up the exported data.

Most of the changes listed below occur in the system setup and general ledger areas. If you export a golden build that uses a single legal entity, you should not need these filters. 

The following entities need filters or special handling when you export the data:

| Area                           | Entity                                 | Action to take                                            |  
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| System setup                   | Legal entities                         | Apply a filter to Company  |
|                                | Number sequence code                   | The number sequence codes can be shared or be specific to a legal entity. If you want to import all number sequences, you must have the legal entities setup for the number sequences that are stored for a specific legal entity. If you only want the shared sequences, apply a filter to remove the number sequences that are specific to a legal entity. If you only want number sequences for a legal entity, apply a filter to Company |
|                                |                                        | Number sequences can also have scope. You must delete number sequences where 1) the SCOPETYPE is DataArea and SCOPEVALUE is not equal to the legal entity or is blank, 2) the SCOPETYPE is LegalEntity and SCOPEVALUE is not equal to the legal entity and 3) the SCOPETYPE is DataAreaFiscalCalendar and SCOPEVALUE is not equal to the legal entity |
|                                | Number sequence references             | Number sequences references can also have scope. You must delete the number sequence references where 1) the SCOPETYPE = DataArea, DataAreaFiscalCalendar, or Legal Entity and 2) the SCOPEVALUE   is blank or is not the legal entity that you want in the data  |
|                                | Organization hierarchies               | There is no legal entity filter. Manually remove any references to the other legal entities that are not being imported. For example, if you have set up Centralized payments but you are only loading one legal entity, then you must not import the Centralized payments hierarchy  |
| Global address book            | Multiple entities                      | The global address book contains data for all legal entities. All legal entities will be created when you import the data unless you remove the data for the legal entities that you do not want to load.  Delete all records for other legal entities to ensure that those legal entities are not created or apply a filter to the Legal entity data area (<> blank). You will also need to remove global address book records that are used in the other legal entities |
|                                | Party postal addresses                 | Address records for legal entities other than the one being imported must be manually be deleted before import |
|                                | Party contacts                         | Contact records for legal entities other than the one being imported must be manually be deleted before import |
|                                | Workflow                               | Apply a filter on DataAreaID. Many of the workflow entities cannot be filtered for legal entity so you may see import failures if you do not remove the data in all workflow entities related to other legal entities that you do not want. We recommend setting up workflows manually for this scenario.|
| General ledger                 | Ledger                                 | Apply a filter to Company  |  
|                                | Ledger fiscal calendar year            | Apply a filter to Ledger name  |
|                                | Ledger fiscal calendar period          | Apply a filter to Ledger name  |
|                                | Main account legal entity overrides    | Apply a filter to Company |
|                                | Financial dimension value legal entity | Apply a filter to Legal entity but also include records with empty legal entities (shared values)|
|                                | Financial dimension values             | Apply a filter to Legal entity. However, you cannot filter out custom dimension values so you will need to delete them. They will be restored when you import data for the tables that are backing the custom dimensions |
|                                | Journal names                          | Apply a filter to Voucher series company ID |
|                                | Ledger allocation basis source         | Apply a filter to Legal entity |
|                                | Ledger allocation rule destination     | Apply a filter to Company |
| Accounts receivable            | Customer write-off reason code         | Apply a filter to Company  |
| Budget                         | Budget control configuration           | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control configuration activation| Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control cycle model             | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control dimension attribute     | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control documents and journals  | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control group                   | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control group criteria          | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control message level           | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control over budget permissions | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control rule                    | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |
|                                | Budget control rule criteria           | Apply a filter to Legal entity              |

### Changing the legal entity value before importing
If you want to change the legal entity ID to another value, you must change the values in all fields like those listed above to the new legal entity value. For example, for Legal entities, change Company from the exported value to a new value in the exported file. 

There are many places where the legal entity ID is stored so making this change can be difficult and cause errors. We are considering a feature to help do this work in a future release.

Import a configuration
----------------------

The data management workspace is also your hub for importing
configuration data projects. You can build a configuration project from
an existing data project that you exported or from individual files that
contain data formatted correctly for import into Dynamics 365 for
Finance and Operations.

The process for importing a configuration is as follows:

1)  Open the data management workspace and switch to the Enhanced view.

2)  Select the Import tile in the data management workspace.

3)  Select New to create the configuration project and add an ID and
    name that represents the configuration

4)  Select the data project operation type (Import) and project category
    (Configuration).

5)  Use the Add file button to select the file that has your entity
    information and data. For data packages, the file will have a ZIP file extension,
    The extension of the file name will be matched
    to the default file extensions in the data sources and the source
    data format will be populated automatically. If you have not set up
    the default file extensions, then select a source data format first
    before you select the file.
    
6)  When you load a package, the import page reads the list of entities from the package first. 
    A progress bar displays how much of the package has been read. Once the list of entities is read, 
    the import page starts loading the data in the package. This process can take some time to execute.

6)  Use Remove entity to remove one or more selected entities

You are ready to import a configuration. However, you may want to use
some additional features to control the export process:

1)  Organize your list by using the Sort by button to reorder your
    entities by unit, level and sequence

2)  If want to change the execution sequence of any of the entities,
    edit the unit, level, or sequence manually or use the resequence
    button to update any entities that you have selected.

3)  If necessary, change the entity mappings using the View map icon.

4)  Use the check box in the Disable column to temporarily stop the
    entity from being used when exporting a data project

Now that you have completed your configuration, use the import button to
start the import. You can monitor your results on the execution details
page that is displayed.

Templates
---------

The templates page provides you with the tools to create a template of
entities. The form is very similar to the configurations form and the
features work in much the same way. The process for creating templates
is:

1)  Use New button to create the template. Add an ID and name that
    represents the template. Note that the status is set to “Draft”

2)  Add entities or remove them as needed.

3)  Organize your list by using the Sort by button to reorder your
    entities by entity group or by unit, level and sequence

4)  If want to change the sequence of any of the entities, edit the
    unit, level, or sequence manually or use the resequence button to
    update any entities that you have selected. You must select more
    than one entity for that button to appear

5)  Add filters to the entity with the Filter icon. Then review the
    results of the filters using the Preview icon. If you add a filter, the filter icon will change to an edit icon.

6)  If necessary, use the View map icon to exclude fields that you do not want mapped

7)  Use the Validate template button to change the status to Validated.

Your template is ready to be used in a project. However, you may want to
use some additional features to control the export process:

1)  If you already have a list of entities that you want to add quickly,
    use the Open in Excel button to open Excel. Copy and paste your
    entities in Excel and click on the Publish button

2)  If you exported a template and you want to bring that template back
    into Dynamics, select Import template, browse to the template file, 
    and then click on Create template to load it

3)  If you want to replace the contents of an existing template, select
    the replace from template button, browse to the template file that has
    the entities that you want to import, and click on Create template to load it. 
    The template values in the current template will be replaced by the new template.

4)  If you want to create a template from a project, use New button to create the template. Add an ID and name that
    represents the template. Use the Replace template from
    project button to display a list of projects to choose from. Select
    a project and click on Create template to bring the project entities into the
    template. Any existing entities will be removed before the project
    entities are copied into the template.

### Loading default templates
-----------------------------

Default templates are delivered with each new release of the product. Our long term goal is to provide the templates in LCS so that you can push them into an instance of Dynamics 365 for Financial and Operations. However, for the current releases, click on the Templates tile in the data management workspace and click on the Load default template menu option to load the templates.

Once the templates are loaded, you can change them to suit your business needs. However, if you want to retrieve the original default templates, you can use the Load default templates button to add them back to your system. You can either replace the templates with the latest versions or select an option to make a copy the old templates first and then add the default templates.

### Merged templates
--------------------

We have created larger templates that cover multiple module areas. You can use the larger templates or any combination of smaller templates to build a data project. These combined template are:
-   System and Shared, which includes system setup, global address book, shared general ledger, and workflow
-   Financials, which includes general ledger, bank, accounts payable, tax, accounts receivable, fixed assets, and budgeting
-   Supply chain management, which includes inventory management, product management, procurement, sales and marketing, limited warehouse management, production control, and costing

The Expense and Project Management templates are not included in a larger template but they are designed to easily merge into a project that uses other templates.
 
### Master data in the templates
--------------------------------

Many of the templates include entities for master data such as customers, vendors, and released products. These are included to indicate the proper sequence of entities that you will need once you have loaded parameters and reference data. Master entities are most often sequenced in the module bands number from 100 and up (see sequencing philosophy) and they will shown in the grid under entity category as master. 

If you do not want to include master data in your configuration, remove those entities from your project.

### Templates with the same entity
----------------------------------

There are entities that are needed in more than one template. For example, you need payment terms in both Accounts payable and Accounts receivable. However, you may only need the Accounts receivable template. We added the entity to both templates for situations where you may only need one of the templates.

A data project can only have one instance of an entity in it. If you add a template that contains an entity that already exists in a data project, the entity in that template will replace the entity that is currently in the project. 

You can use this capability to override the default templates without changing them. For example, if the worker field has been unmapped in your data project but you have your own template that adds workers, you can build a template that includes the entities that have the worker field. In that template, you can map the worker field and it will replace the entities in the data project that unmapped the field.

Sequencing philosophy for templates
-----------------------------------

### Units, levels and sequences

The unit, level and sequence is used in data management to control the
order in which the data is exported or imported.

-   Entities with two different units are processed in parallel.

-   Within a unit, entities are processed in parallel if they have the
    same level.

-   Within the same level, they are processed by the sequence order
    within the level.

-   Once a level is completed, the next level is processed.

-   We use only unit 1 to ensure that all dependencies are handled in
    the correct order.

Entities are categorized by module name, entity category, and a tag. The
module represents the module that the entity is normally used for. The
entity category represents the type of information in the category, like
parameters or reference data.

Tags provide additional details about the function of the entity in that
feature area. For example, entities for the general ledger have a module
name of General Ledger. There are several tasks within the general
ledger and the tags represent those tasks. For example, Setup and Journals
are tags that represent tasks that can be done for the general ledger.

### Sequencing philosophy

Our long term goal for sequencing is to automatically sequence all of the entities for every
configuration. Until we reach that goal, we have created sequences for the
entities in each of the templates that represent the dependency order between entities.

The following list shows how the templates were set up to handle the
dependencies. Please note that the entities do *not* require the
sequences numbers that have been assigned. You can sequence them differently if you want. 
However, you may inadvertently change the order in which entities are 
processed. If an entity requires data that has not been imported by another entity, you may see errors due to  
missing dependent data.

|-------------------------	|--:	|----:	|
| System setup            	| 1 	|  10 	|

| Band 6 for dependencies 	| 1 	|  80 	| 
| Band 7 for dependencies 	| 1 	|  90 	| 
| Bank                    	| 1 	| 100 	|
| Accounts payable        	| 1 	| 120 	|

| Inventory management    	| 1 	| 300 	|
| Product management      	| 1 	| 310 	|
| Procurement             	| 1 	| 320 	| 
| Sales and Marketing     	| 1 	| 330 	|
| Warehouse management    	| 1 	| 400 	|
| Production control      	| 1 	| 410 	|
| Costing                 	| 1 	| 420 	|
| Retail                  	| 1 	| 500 	| 
| Expense management      	| 1 	| 600 	|
| Project accounting      	| 1 	| 650 	|
| Human resources         	| 1 	| 700 	|
| Payroll                 	| 1 	| 800 	|

We reserved levels 10-22 for the shared system entities so that they are
processed first. Almost all systems also use the company specific
general ledger entities so we reserved level 25 for those entities.
These levels represent the minimum basic setup required for most
shared data in a configuration.

Once the basic setup is complete, there are many entities that can
be loaded in parallel across all the modules. Instead of forcing them to
be loaded in silos by module, we set up bands of dependencies between
the data for different entities. We added entities that have no
dependencies to band 30. We then added band 40 for entities that have a
dependency on the entities in band 30. We continued the process for
bands 50 to 90.

After organizing the basic entities so that they can process in
parallel, we organized the remaining entities by module in the order
that the modules should be processed. However, there are a lot of
entities that have many dependencies, some of which are complex. For
example, the vendor posting profiles may need vendors or items. Although
that entity would be in the accounts payable module, it needs to happen
after product management. In that case, if vendors are 1.130.10 and
items are 1.300.10, then vendor posting profiles must be moved to
something after that sequence like 1.310.20.

In short, the sequences described are a guideline, not a requirement.
There is no required relationship between a level and a module. You can
rearrange the entities if the sequence doesn’t work for your
installation. If you want to add your own templates to a configuration,
you can follow the guidelines above to ensure that your template merges
correctly into a project that uses other templates.

Additional information about entities
---------

### Obsolete entities
-----------------

As we create newer versions of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, we may need to update the functionality of an entity. A new entity may be created with a different name and the original entity will be marked as obsolete. You will no longer be able to add the obsolete entities to a new data project or template. 

If you load a data package that has the obsolete entity in it, you will be warned about the existence of an obsolete entity but you will be able to still import your data. You can find the obsolete entities by selecting the Obsolete column and filtering on Yes.

### Self referencing entities
-------------------------

There are entities that represent tables that have references to themselves. For example, when you create a cash discount, you can refer to related cash discount that creates a tiered discount calculation. To import data, it is necessary to sequence the data so that the cash discount referred to in the Next cash discount field is imported first, followed by the cash discount that uses it. 

We have added a class called DMFImportExportSequencer that will sequence the data in self referencing entities and enable the data to load in a single pass. You can view the code required to update entities in the Cash Discount entity (CashDiscountEntity).

We have added the class to a number of self referencing entities and we will add it to more entities as needed. Further examples of this type of entity includes:
-   Customers
-   Customer definitions
-   Customer details
-   Tax codes
-   Budget control groups
-   Projects
-   Product categories
-   Warehouses
-   Budget plan workflow stage
-   Sales units
