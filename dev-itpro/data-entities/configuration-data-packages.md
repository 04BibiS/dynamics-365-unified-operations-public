# Configuration data packages

## Overview

Configuration data packages are available as process data packages from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services to help you improve implementation repeatability and accelerate configuration of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. The data packages contain configuration entity spreadsheets populated with best practice data to create an initial golden build. The data entities are also sequenced appropriately within the data packages for a successful single-click import of the data. There are three different types of data included in the entity spreadsheets.
-   Business data: The spreadsheet contains standard business data for a mid-sized trade or retail company. This data combines best practices and business standards to be used as a starting point for your configuration.
-   Sample data: The spreadsheet contains data to be used as an example for business-specific data. This data can be imported and used as an example but will need to be changed for individual business practices.
-   No data: The spreadsheet does not contain any data. There are several areas of the product that are unique to each business and their business practices, and must be configured specifically for the organization. These spreadsheets should be reviewed and updated for the organization as appropriate.

The type of data included in each entity spreadsheet in the data packages is described in the [Data packages](#data-packages-system) section. You can either modify individual spreadsheets before importing the data packages, or import the data packages as they have been supplied and then update your data in the system.

## Using of configuration data packages
Configuration data packages can be accessed from LCS, and either applied to an LCS environment or downloaded to be manually imported into Finance and Operations.

1.  Open your LCS project, and navigate to the Asset library.
2.  In the **Asset type** list, select **Process data packages**.
3.  Click **Import**.
4.  Select the **Configuration data package**.
5.  Click **Pick**.

At this point you have the option to use the **Consume** function to apply the process data package to an LCS environment.

You can also download the individual data package files from the Data packages area. Use the Data management workspace within Finance and Operations to import the data packages from LCS. See [Copy configuration data between companies](copy-configuration.md) for additional information on importing and exporting configurations.

## Special considerations
**System setup** The System data package must be imported before any other data packages. By default, the system data package will create a new legal entity, ST01, and the module area data packages are dependent upon this legal entity.

**General ledger** A generic chart of accounts is included in the configuration data package. When this data is used as defined in the Main account entity spreadsheet, posting profiles across the system will also populate with default posting data. If you change the main accounts used for the chart of accounts, then you will also need to update the individual posting profiles and posting accounts for each area.
