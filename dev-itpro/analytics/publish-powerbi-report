The steps outlined in this article require administrative privileges in the
Dynamics 365 for Operations subscription. As an administrator, part of your responsibilities include uploading
Analytical applications authored within the organization to Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) as an implementation asset. 
Once the reports have been uploaded to an LCS project they can be published to production environments.  This represents the Application Lifecycle Management process for
transitioning Analytical applications from developer environments into production.

## Publishing Analytical Applications on PowerBI.com
Before continuing, make sure that have you've verified and packaged your Analytical Applications into a PBIX file using Power BI Desktop. 
See details here for details on creating Analytical Applications using the local Entity Store database.  Once you're ready to promote your solution, use the following walk-thru as a guide
for publishing Analytical Applications to PowerBI.com.

# Step 1) Upload reports to Dynamics Lifecycle Services
Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) is the tool used to migrate development artifacts from developer to production environments.  LCS supports migrating PBIX files between environments. 

-  Launch LCS (http://lcs.dynamics.com) from the developer environment. 
   If you haven’t created a project in the LCS environment, create a project. Scroll to the right and select the Asset library icon.
