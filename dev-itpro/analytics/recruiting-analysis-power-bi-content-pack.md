# Recruiting Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes the **Recruiting** Power BI content. It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Accessing the Power BI content
If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update, the **Recruiting** Power BI content is shown on the **Recruitment management** workspace. 

## Reports and visuals in the Recruitment management workspace
The **Recruitment management** workspace contains an **Analytics** tab. This tab contains the embedded Power BI content for recruiting. The content consists of an overview tab with additional tabs containing details. The table below describes the reports contained in each of the tabs.

| Report                       | Contents                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recruitment Overview         | Summarizes other reports        |
| Applicant Analysis           | Total number of applicants, applicants by job, applicant sources, female to male applicants, and applicants by location                                                  |
| Applicant Status       | Applicants by type and status, and applicant status                           |
| Recruiting Analysis | Net hire ratio, average days to hire, percentage of bad hires, recruiting costs, number of recruitment projects, hire to applied, applicants versus openings by recruitment project |


## Understanding the data model and entities
The following table shows the entities that the content pack was based on.



These entities were used to create calculated measures. These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the Recruiting.pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that youâ€™ve added.
