# Modify an Electronic reporting format by reapplying a Microsoft Excel template
The Electronic reporting (ER) tool is designed for generating business documents in an electronic format. To generate a business document, you must create an ER format and then use the ER designer to define the layout of business document and specify the data that will be included. Then, you can run that ER format to generate the document.

The Electronic reporting (ER) tool can be used to generate business documents as Excel files. An Excel document can be used as a template for these documents. To define the document layout in the ER designer, you can import the content of the Excel document that you want to use to the defined ER format. For more detailed information and to gain practice in this scenario, play the task guide, **ER Design a configuration for generating reports in OPENXML format** (part of the 7.5.4.3 Acquire/Develop IT service/solution components (10677) business process).

With new ER functionality, you can edit an Excel document that has been used as a template for a business document and then reapply the modified Excel document to ER format so that the format adheres to the updated template. For more details about this functionality, play the task guide, **ER Modify format by reapplying an Excel template** (part of the 7.5.5.3 Acquire/Develop IT service/solution components (10683) business process). As part of the task guide step for importing an updated template, use the modified file template of the Payment Report Excel file, SampleVendPaymWsReport2, as a template.
