# Document generation, publishing, and printing capabilities in on-premises deployments

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the document generation, publishing, & printing capabilities present in the on-premise deployments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.  The platform provides a fully integrated enterprise document generation experience powered by Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).  The service allows users to produce standard industry documents linked to business processes like Sales Invoices, Checks, & Packing Slips from any supported device.  Administrators can use built-in tools to configure the service to allow users to securely connect to network printers.

Upgrade legacy solutions built-on the AX 2012 SQL Reporting Services framework or take advantage of modern solutions available in [Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com).

## Document Publishing Services: Secure, Reliable, and Convenient
Employees spend a great deal of time on the go.  As a result, businesses depend heavily on their employees’ ability to stay productive while working remotely.  Even in today’s modern world, documents remain critical for business transactions and record keeping.  

Dynamics 365 for Operations allows customers to print documents on network printers from mobile devices, automate the creation of business documents, and use built-in tools to configure document routing instructions to multiple recipients.

**Publishing options:**
- **Email –** server based distribution of mail with reports linked as attachments.
- **Archive –** store reports for future reference and regulatory compliance
- **File –** produce a PDF file that’s downloaded directly to the browser for local printing
- **Print –** send documents directly to network printers from all supported platforms including mobile devices.

For a high-level summary of information access options available in the Cloud hosted solution, see the Document Reporting Services Overview article for additional details.
