Instead of using GitHub issues, please consider these options if you need help or have feedback:

-	Feedback or questions about technical articles are best handled through the Livefyre thread at the bottom of each article. This makes it clear to us which article you are talking about.

-	Suggested changes to technical articles are best handled as proposals for change through pull requests. Each pull request is reviewed by the article author or a related subject matter expert for the article.

-	If you need support using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, your best bets are the Dynamics 365 community forums (https://community.dynamics.com/) and our support channels. For more information about support, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-support.

-	Product and feature feedback is best handled through the Dynamics 365 Ideas Portal: https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/
