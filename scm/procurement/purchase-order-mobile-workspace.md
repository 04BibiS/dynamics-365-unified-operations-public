# Purchase order mobile workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the Purchase order mobile workspace that is available for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app. 
The workspace lets you view and respond to purchase orders with actions such as approve or reject.
 

# Overview of the Purchase order approval mobile workspace
Purchase orders that requires approval are taken through an approval workflow. There can be different steps in the workflow that require one or more person to take action. This could be completing a task or approving the purchase order. 
The purchase approval mobile workspace makes it easier to view and respond to purchase orders by displaying the purchase order on your mobile phone. It also allows you to take the same workflow actions as from the Dynamics 365 for Financials and Operations web client.
