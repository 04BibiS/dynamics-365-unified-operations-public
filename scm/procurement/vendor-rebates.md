# Vendor rebates
[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Vendor rebates help companies better manage their supplier rebate programs by automating tasks that are involved in administering, 
tracking, and claiming rebates that are earned.

This topic provides examples and a broad overview of the vendor rebates. In these examples, several types of users will perform 
their respective tasks:

● Registering details of the negotiated rebate agreements with individual vendors or a group of vendors

● Running the negotiated contracts through ongoing purchases and generating rebate claims

● Approving and processing the generated claims, so that they can be passed on to Accounts payable (A/P) for collection

# Examples overview

## Example - Review a vendor rebate agreement

This example walks you through a vendor rebate agreement. A vendor rebate agreement is a record of a contract with a vendor 
that specifies the negotiated terms and conditions under which the company qualifies for a monetary reward in return for achieving 
preset purchase targets.

## Example – Purchase products that qualify for a rebate and generate a rebate claim

When purchase orders are placed with a vendor that the company has a rebate agreement with, if those orders qualify for the rebate, 
the program identifies the future vendor credit payments and generates claims for every order line that is invoiced. This example 
illustrates this automatic process, and it also explains how to review the expected rebates and see the impact of those rebates
on the product’s cost and profit margin.

## Example – Process the claim and pass it as receivable to A/P

Generated rebate claims represent the future payments that can be expected from the vendor. Before a credit note is issued to the
vendor, the agreement owner typically wants to review the claims and approve them. In this example, after the claims have been approved,
the A/P administrator processes them. As a result, a credit memo (vendor invoice) for the rebate claim amount is automatically created 
and posted. The credit is then added to the vendor balance, and the A/P team can include it in the regular settlement process.

### Prerequisites

The following examples use the USMF demo company. The following parameters are set on the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page:

● On the **Prices** tab, the **Enable price details** option is set to **Yes**.

● On the **Margin alerts** tab, the **Enable margin alert** option is set to **Yes**.

### Example – Review a vendor rebate agreement

Let’s start by becoming familiar with how the purchase manager has captured the company’s new rebate agreement with vendor US-101, Fabrikam Electronics, which is a supplier of a product range within TV sets.

**●** Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Vendor rebates** \> **Rebate agreements**.

Currently, there is one agreement, which qualifies for a rebate when it makes purchases that meet these conditions:

● Item T0020, TelevisionD30042", is purchased.
● The item is purchased from vendor US-101.
● A minimum quantity of 10 units is purchased.

![Purchase agreement](media/purchase-agreement.PNG)

Several fields provide more detail about the agreement’s conditions as they were negotiated with the vendor:

● In the **Cumulate purchase by** field, **Invoice** indicates that a rebate claim will be determined every time that a purchase order line is invoiced.Purchases don’t have to be accumulated over a period.

To make the calculation of the rebate claim amount depend on the period, the user can select one of the other available options:

-   **Week**
-   **Month**
-   **Year**
-   **Lifetime**
-   **Customized period**

● The **Rebate program accrual account** and **Rebate program expense account** fields must specify account numbers that will receive accrued rebate amounts during the intermediate stage between approval and processing.

● In the **Rebate line break type** field, **Quantity** indicates that the rebates are volume-based. **Amount** would indicate that the rebates are amount-based.

On the agreement’s **Lines** FastTab, the two lines specify the quantity tiers that grant different rebates, as follows:

**●** Purchases for product quantities between 10 and 19 units qualify for a rebate of USD 15 per unit.

**●** Purchases for quantities of 20 units and more qualify for a rebate of USD 30 per unit.

![Agreement status](media/Agreement-status.jpg)

Notice that the agreement status is **Approved**. This status indicates that the agreement can be applied to purchase orders that meet the agreement’s conditions.

### Example – Purchase products that qualify for a rebate and generate a rebate claim

The vendor rebate agreement that authorizes Contoso to receive a rebate From vendor US-101, Fabrikam Electronics, when it buys item T0020, TelevisionD30042", in any quantity above 10 units, is in place. A purchasing agent now places an order with the vendor.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.
2.  On the **All purchase orders** list page, on the Action Pane, click     **+New**.
3.  In the **Vendor account** field, select **US-101**, and then click **OK**.
4.  On the **Purchase order** page, enter an order line for item **T0020** and a quantity of **30**.
5.  In the **Warehouse** field, enter **13**.
6.  Select the order line, and then click **Purchase order line** \> **View** \> **Price details**.
7.  On the **Price details** page, click the **Rebates** FastTab.

On the **Price details** page, the purchasing agent can see that a rebate from the valid vendor rebate agreement for the total amount of USD 900 is applied to the line. The USD 900 is calculated as the line quantity of 30 units multiplied by USD 30, which is the rebate amount per product unit that applies when the line quantity is more than 30 units (the second quantity break on the agreement). This amount is also shown in the **Vendor rebate** field in the **Margin estimation** section of the **Price details** page.

1.  Close the **Price details** page.
2.  On the **Purchase order** page, on the Action Pane, on the **Purchase** tab, in the **Actions** group, click **Confirm**. You can now invoice the order.
3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Invoice** tab, in the **Generate** group, click **Invoice**.
4.  On the **Vendor invoice** page, in the **Default from** field, select **Ordered quantity**, and then click **OK**.
5.  In the **Number** field, enter **fab-12345** as the invoice identifier. 
6.  On the Action Pane, click **Post**.
7.  The purchase invoice has now been posted, and the rebate claim has been generated for the invoice line.
8.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Vendor Rebates**\> **Rebate claims**.

The next steps are to review, approve, and process the claim into the
receivable.

### Example – Process the claim and pass it as receivable to A/P

The vendor agreement owner is responsible for periodically reviewing and, as required by the company’s policy, approving the rebate claims that are generated. After claims are approved, the A/P administrator passes them as credit notes to the regular receivables processing.

1. Open the rebate claim.

The rebate balance amount for this claim is USD 900 (30 units multiplied by the rebate amount of USD 30).

> [!NOTE] 
> When a claim is generated, its status is **Calculated**. This status is used because the rebate is granted per invoice, not on a cumulative basis.

2. Close the rebate claim.
3. Mark the claim, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Approve**.
4. On the request page, in the **Vendor** field, select **US-101**, and then click **OK**.

Message bars inform the user that a Rebate accrual journal has been posted for the claim amount. This posting has debited the Accrued Vendor Rebates Receivable account for the expected vendor credit and credited the interim Accrued Vendor Rebates Received account for the expected gain.

![Message](media/message.png)

5. In the rebate list, select the line, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Rebate transactions** to see and navigate to the journal batch number for this rebate accrual posting. 

The A/P clerk must now complete the rebate claim handling by running the Process
function.

6. On the Action Pane, click **Process**.
7. On the **Process rebates** page, click **Filter**. In the **Criteria** field for the **Vendor account** field, select **US-101**, and then click **OK**.

The message bars and the status has changed to **Completed** indicate that the following events have occurred:

● A Rebate accrual journal posting has reversed the previous interim amounts on the accrual receivable and expense accounts.

● A vendor invoice (credit note) for the rebate amount has been created and posted.

> [!NOTE] 
> The setting of the **Manual invoice posting** option on the **Rebate program** tab of the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page determines whether a vendor invoice is posted automatically as part of claim processing or manually.

● As a result, the vendor’s Payable account has been debited, and the Discounts and Allowances Received account has been credited.

> [!NOTE] 
> The Discounts and Allowances Received account number is specified for the procurement category that is used on the purchase invoice line for the rebate. The procurement category, in turn, is set on the **Rebate program** tab of the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page.

8. In the rebate list, select the line, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Rebate transactions** to see and navigate to the journal batch number for this rebate accrual posting and also the vendor invoice number.
9. Select the line for the vendor invoice transaction, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Vendor invoice**.

The Invoice journal shows details for the invoice.

The line specifies the details of the vendor invoice for the **Commissions and Rebates** procurement category, a quantity **–1**, and an amount of **–900**. This line represents Contoso’s rebate claim to vendor US-101.

10. Click **Accounts payable** \> **All vendors**.
11. Select vendor **US-101**, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Transactions**.
12. Find the line for invoice.

The positive amount of USD 900 has now been added to the vendor balance.

The process for handling vendor rebates involves multiple manual tracking tasks that are often tedious. By automating these tasks, vendor rebate management helps with the following processes:

1. Generating accurate rebate claims
2. Accruing the expected receivable and interim gain in the general ledger
3. Updating the vendor balance and the income statement with the allowance that is due

In this way, the vendor rebate management feature helped Contoso employees avoid potential errors and associated rework, and contributed to a timely positive cash flow for the company.
