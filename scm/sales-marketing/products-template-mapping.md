Template and task
-----------------

The following templates and underlying tasks are used to synchronize products
from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition
(Finance and Operations) to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales (Sales).

-   Name of template: Products (Fin and Ops to Sales)

-   Name of task in project: Products

 

Sync tasks required prior to Product sync: None  
Entity set

| **Finance and Operations** | **CDS** | **Sales**  |
|----------------------------|---------|------------|
| Sellable released products | Product | Products   |

 

Entity flow
-----------

Products are managed in Finance and Operations and synchronized to Sales. The
data entity **Sellable released products** in Operations only exports products
that are sellable, which means that products have the information required to be
used on a sales order. The same rules apply when a product is validated with the
**Validate** function on the **Released product** page.

The **Product number** is used as key, meaning that product variants are
synchronized to CDS and Sales with individual **Product IDs** per **Product
variant**.

 

Prospect to cash solution for Sales
-----------------------------------

In Sales, a new field on the products **Is Externally Maintained** is added to
indicate that a given product is maintained externally. The value is set to
**Yes** by default during import to Sales.

-   **Is Externally Maintained = Yes**: Product originates from Finance and
    Operations and will not be editable in Sales.

-   **Is Externally Maintained = No**: Product is entered directly in Sales.

-   **Is Externally Maintained = Blank**: Product exists in Sales prior to
    enabling the Prospect to cash solution.

The **Is Externally Maintained** information is used to ensure that only
**Quotes** and **Sales orders** with **Externally maintained products** will
sync to Finance and Operations.  
 

**Externally maintained products** are automatically added to the first valid
**Price list** with the same currency. Note that the list is organized
alphabetically by **Name**. The product sales price from Finance and Operations
is used as price on the **Price list**. This means that it is required to have a
**Price list** in Sales for each **Product sales currency** in Finance and
Operations. Currency on the released sellable products is set to the accounting
currency in the legal entity, from which the product is exported.

Note that product sync will not succeed without a **Price list** with the
matching currency.

Preconditions and mapping setup
-------------------------------

-   Before you run the very first sync, you must populate the **Distinct product
    table** for existing products in Finance and Operations. Existing products
    will not be synchronized until this job is completed.

    -   In Finance and Operations, use Search to search for **Populate distinct
        product table**.

    -   Click the **Populate distinct product table** to run the job. This job
        only needs to be run once.

-   Ensure that the needed **ValueMap** for selling **Unit of measure (**UOM) in
    Finance and Operations exists in the **Source -\> CDS mapping
    SalesUnitSymbol / DefaultSellingUnitOfMeasure**.

-   Ensure that **Decimals supported** for UOM match your requirements in **CDS
    -\> Destination**. If you require different values per UOM, this can be done
    with ValueMap from Unit, for example, [Each : 0] & [Pound : 2].

    -   Template value is defaulted to 0.

-   Update the **CDS Organization ID Organization_OrganizationId** in **Source
    -\> CDS**.

    -   Template value is defaulted to ORG001.

-   Update **ValueMap** for **Unit group** (**defaultuomscheduleid.name**) in
    **CDS -\> Destination** to match the **Unit groups** in Sales.

    -   Template value is defaulted to **Default unit**.

-   Ensure that all products selling UOMs from Finance and Operations exist in
    Sales with the **CDS picklists** value.

-   Ensure that **Price lists** exist in Sales for each product sales currency
    in Finance and Operations.

-   Products can be created in Sales with status **Draft** or **Active**. This
    is controlled in **System settings** under **Sales** in Sales.

    -   Products created with draft status need to be activated before they can
        be added to **Quote** or **Sales order**.
