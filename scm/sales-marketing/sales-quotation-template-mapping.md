# Sales quotation headers and lines

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The topic discusses the templates and underlying tasks that are used to synchronize sales quotation headers and lines accounts from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. 

## Template and Task

The following templates and underlying tasks are used to synchronize sales quotation headers and lines from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales (Sales) to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (Finance and Operations).

Name of template: Sales Quotes (Sales to Fin and Ops)

Name of task in project:

-   QuoteHeader

-   QuoteLine

Sync tasks required prior to Sales quotation header and lines sync:

-   Products

-   Accounts (if used)

-   Contacts (if used)

## Entity set

| **Sales**    | **CDS**       | **Finance and Operations** |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Quotes       | Quotation     | Sales quotation headers    |
| QuoteDetails | QuotationLine | CDS sales quotation lines  |

## Entity flow

Sales quotations are created in Sales and synchronized to Finance and Operations.  
 
Sales quotations from Sales will only be synchronized under the following conditions:

1.  All products on the quotation lines are externally maintained.

2.  The quotation is active or activated.

## Prospect to cash solution for Sales

The field **Has Externally Maintained Products Only** is added to the **Quote** entity to consistently keep track of whether the sales order is made up entirely of **Externally Maintained Products**, in which case **Products** maintained in Finance and Operations. This is done to ensure that you don't try to sync **Sales order lines** with **Products** that are unknown to Finance and Operations.

All **Quote products/lines** are updated with the **Externally Maintained** information from the **Quote header** and this information can be found in the field **Quote Has Externally Maintained Products Only** on the **Quote line** entity.

**Discount**, **Charges** and **Tax** are controlled by a complex setup in Finance and Operations, which does not allow for integration mapping at this point. The current design is that **Price**, **Discount**, **Charge** and **Tax** are mastered and handled by Finance and Operations.

In Sales, the solution makes the following fields read-only because these values do not sync to Finance and Operations.

-   Read-only on SO Header: Discount %, Discount, Freight Amount

-   Read-only on SO Line: Tax

## Preconditions and mapping setup

-   Before synchronizing quotes, it is important to update Sales with the following setting:

      Under **Settings \> Administration \> System settings \> Sales**, ensure that **Discount calculation method** is set to Per unit. This is done to ensure that the line item discount from Sales match the setting in Finance and Operations. Without this setting the discount would not be correct in Finance and Operations, as Finance and Operations would read the discount as a discount per unit, even if it was per line in Sales.

-   In Finance and Operations, **Number sequence** for **Quotations** must be set to **Manual**.

    -   **Account receivable \> Setup \> Account receivable parameters \> Number sequence - Number sequence for quotations. View details**. Under **General Setup,** set **Manual = Yes**.

-   To avoid sync failing for sales quotations, **Delivery date control** should be set to **None** as default in Finance and Operations. This is done under **Accounts receivable \> Setup \> Accounts receivable parameters \> Shipments**.

### QuoteHeader

-   **Requested delivery date** is required in Finance and Operations and sync will fail if this date is blank. To avoid this issue, the date is defaulted from **Source -\> CDS** in case of blank value. The date should be updated to a preferred value. Currently it is not possible to enter something like Today for today's date, so it must be a given date.

    -   Template value for Requested delivery date is defaulted to 1/1/2020.

-   **Address Country region code** is required in Finance and Operations. To avoid sync errors, you can default a value that is used if the field is left blank in Sales, which can also be useful to avoid having to type **Country region** for local addresses.

    -   Template value for **DeliveryAddressCountryRegionISOCode** is not defaulted.

-   Update the mapping for **CDS Organization ID in Source -\> CDS** to match the **CDS organization** in the **Organization** entity.

    -   Template value for **Organization_OrganizationId** is defaulted to ORG001.

    -   Template value for **Account_Organization_OrganizationId** is defaulted to ORG001.

    -   Template value for **InvoiceAccount_OrganizationId** is defaulted to ORG001.

### QuoteLine

-   Update the mapping for **CDS Organization ID in Source -\> CDS** to match the **CDS organization** in the **Organization** entity

    -   Template value for Organization_OrganizationId is defaulted to ORG001.

    -   Template value for **Product_Organization_Organization_OrganizationId** is defaulted to ORG001.

    -   Template value for **Quotation_Organization_Organization_OrganizationId** is defaulted to ORG001.

-   **Requested delivery date** is required in Finance and Operations and sync will fail if the date is blank. To avoid this issue, the date is defaulted from **Source -\> CDS** in case of blank value. The date should be updated to a preferred value. Currently, it is not possible to enter something like Today for today's date, so it must be a given date.

    -   Template value for **Requested delivery date** is defaulted to 1/1/2020.

-   It possible to add the following mappings from **CDS -\> Destination** to avoid that quotation line fails to import to Finance and Operations if the information is neither defaulted from customer, nor from product.

    -   **SiteId** - Site is required to generate **Quotes** and **Sales order lines** in Operations.

        -   Template value for SiteId is not defaulted.

    -   **WarehouseId** - Warehouse is required to process **Quote** and **Sales order lines** in Finance and Operations.

        -   Template value for WarehouseId is not defaulted.

-   Ensure that the needed **ValueMap** for selling UOM in Finance and Operations exists in the **CDS -\> Destination mapping** for **Quantity_UOM / SALESUNITSYMBOL.**

## Template mapping in data integrator

> [!NOTE]

> **Discount**, **Charges** and **Tax** are controlled by a complex setup in Finance and Operations, which does not allow for integration mapping at this point. The current design is that **Price**, **Discount**, **Charge** and **Tax** are handled by Finance and Operations.

> **Payment terms**, **Freight terms**, **Delivery terms**, **Shipping method**, and **Delivery mode** are not part of the default mappings. Mapping of these fields requires value mapping to be set up, which is specific to the data in the organizations between which the entity is synchronized.

The following screenshots show how the template mapping can look like in data integrator.
