The Prospect to cash solution uses [Data Integrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-service/entity-reference/dynamics-365-integration) to synchronize data across Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (Finance and Operations) and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales (Sales) instances via the Common Data Service. The Prospect to cash templates available with the Data Integrator enable the flow of product, account, contact, and sales quote data between Finance and Operations and Sales. While the data is flowing between Finance and Operations and Sales, you can carry out sales and marketing activities in Sales and handle the order fulfillment with inventory management in Finance and Operations. 

This solution provides integration in the following areas: 

-   Maintain accounts in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations.
-   Maintain contacts in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations.
-   Maintain products in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales.
