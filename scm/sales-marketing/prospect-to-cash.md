The Prospect to cash solution uses [Data Integrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-service/entity-reference/dynamics-365-integration) to synchronize data across Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations or Dynamics 365 for Sales instances via the Common Data Service. The Prospect to cash templates available with the Data Integrator enable the flow of product, account, contact, and sales quote data between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 for Sales.
