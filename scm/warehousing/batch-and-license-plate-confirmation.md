# Overview of batch and license plate confirmation

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Batch confirmation allows you to confirm that the correct batch is being picked from the mobile device. 
On the initial picks of work for batch above-items only, you must verify that the batch that is picked matches the batch on the work line.

License plate confirmation allows you to confirm that the correct license plate is being picked from the mobile device. 
When picking work from a stage location, you must verify that the license plate that is picked matches the license plate that is associated to the work. If the work is started by scanning a license plate, this confirmation step will be skipped.

## Where it applies

- Batch confirmation applies to the initial picks of work for batch above-items.
- License plate confirmation applies to picks from stage locations.

## Set up batch and license plate confirmation
You can configure batch and license plate confirmation from the mobile device menu items.  
1.	From the mobile device menu items, enter the work confirmation setup.  
2.	Select the option for either batch or license plate confirmation. Both options are available for work type picks that do not have automatic confirmation enabled.
