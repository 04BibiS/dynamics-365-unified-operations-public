# Formula designer

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use the **Formula designer** page to design and work with a formula tree structures. The designer graphically displays the formula structure. You can select different configurations and decide what information to display on the nodes of the tree.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you access the designer from the formula, it does not display route information, because the formula is not yet linked to a specific, finished item.

  
## Use the Designer tab

The **Designer** tab contains the following functionality:

-   A functions pane on the left part of the form that enables you to perform
    tasks such as to modify a formula version and to add formula items

-   A designer window that displays the tree structure of the formula

-   Current route information for the formula

-   A list of items

> [!NOTE]
> A site must be specified on the **Setup** tab. It must use either the default setting or one that you select. If the **Site** field is cleared, the tree does not display. If there are sub-formulas that use other sites, these do not display inside the tree. The tree displays only the information for one site at a time.

The following table shows the actions that you can perform for each function in the icon pane.

## Use the Setup tab

Use the **Setup** tab to customize the information that is shown on the **Designer** form.

| **Field group**     | **Field**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Search criteria** | **Display principle** | Select the version-display principle that applies to the current formula structure and the current route.                                                                                                                                    |
| —-                  | **Version date**      | Enter the version date for the formula and route. The version is used to identify which formula version to use on a specific date, as determined by the version dates in the formula-version setup.                                          |
| **Lines**           | **Show valid only**   | When the check box is selected, only formula lines that have valid dates are displayed in the tree structure. To open the **Edit formula line** form and view the validity dates for the formula line, right-click or double-click the line. |
| **Formula**         | All check-box fields  | Select the criteria to display in the tree structure. The designer displays the selected criteria at the bottom of both tabs.                                                                                                                |
| **Route**           | All check-box fields  | Select the criteria to display for the routes.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

-   When the principle is set to **Active** or **Selected/Active**, the valid
    formula or route version for this date is found.

-   The date is also used to find valid formula lines if **Show valid only** is
    selected.
