# Coupons for retail sales

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Merging call center coupons with retail discounts

In prior releases of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and Microsoft Dynamics 365 call center coupons and discount codes on retail discounts were two unrelated features that shared a common purpose. They enabled discount targeting and discount controls for a retailer. A retailer can limit which customers with the code are entitled to the discount.
With this update we have merged call center coupons with retail discounts to provide a unified experience for managing and accepting coupons in all retail channels. At the highest level the combined feature uses the codes from coupons and the discount value from retail discounts.

At a glance to merge the two features we did the following.
- Removed the discount code and bar code fields from the retail discount forms
- Added a link from coupon to a retail discount
- Enabled multiple coupon codes to be created for a single coupon
- Removed the discount value definition from the coupons form
- Removed the customer and product references from the coupon
- Removed the direct GL posting of a coupon liability
- Removed the charge code parameter for coupons


For a comparison here is a table of the features of the merged coupons compared to discount codes and call center coupons.

## Managing coupons

You need to create the discount and the coupon independently and then link them by choosing the discount in the coupon form.
Once you link a coupon to a discount, a number of fields on the discount become read only because they are managed by the coupon's settings. Fields such as status and standard date ranges.
 
### Partial updates and upgrades

Dynamics 365 servicing does not enforce applying updates for all components together. In addition the retail solution is a distributed solution which also means updates may not be applied completely accross the solution. The coupon feature because it is a merge of two existing features and involves discount calculation it is important to understand the impact of a partial update. 
- **Headquarters only partial update**: There are forms and binary updates that are applied in HQ. The retail price engine is updated with the binary update. It is used to calculate price in sales order and price simulator. The coupon and discount forms are updated with the HQ forms update. If only one of the two update parts are applied you will get forms that do not match the price calculation data. This will cause either unexpected discount calculation or errors during discount calculation. 
- **HQ updated, Retail server and POS not updated(N-1)**: Retail server handles price calculation with the price engine. We always support updating HQ before updating retail stores. This is because not all stores can be updated at the same time. In this scenario new functionality related to coupons won't be available in non-updated retail stores. For example 'exclude' lines have been introduced with coupons. However if you use exclude lines on a discount they will not be applied in a retail store running a previous version.
- **HQ not updated, Retail server and POS updated(N+1)**: The updated price engine in retail server knows how to handle legacy discount codes during price calculation so in this you should see no functional impact of the update.
