3. Do we support other payment connector providers?
        • Yes, via customization
        
4. What is a payment connector and in what cases do I need to deploy/implement a payment connector?
        a. Payment connectors are software components that can be set up in the Dynamics applications, that enable the Dynamics Applications to process payments for card present (devices) and card not present (e commerce/call center) scenarios. There can be out of box connectors like Verifone and MasterCard that ship with Dynamics, or the ere can be connectors built by Payment ISV partners.
        b. A connector is typically built on the discretion of the customer's business needs. For example, when there is any scenario that needs a new type of payment type (e.g. Linked Refunds) and if the same functionality is not available in the out of box connectors, that could be a reason to consider building your own connector. Similarly different geographies may need new connectors if the out of box connectors do not support those regions.
        
5. What is the SLA for out-of-box payment connector like Verifone?
        • The SLA for the out of box connectors like Verifone and Mastercard is owned the Payment connector providers themselves. Please contact the Verifone and Master Card support for their respective Support SLAs.
        
6. If a supported payment provider issues an update, will Microsoft automatically update the payment connector or do I need to work with payment provider to get the updated payment connector?
        • If a new update of the payment connector is issued by the connector provider,  the updated version of the Payment connector will be included in the next planned release of the Dynamics 365. However, the customer can also directly work with the out of box payment connector provider
        
7. Who are the different personas involved in Payment scenarios?
        • Customer ( Customer IT, Implementation partner, Cashier or equivalent, Shopper (C2))
        • Payment Connector provider + payment connector provider partner (out of box connector or external connector)
        • Payment Acquirer
        • Microsoft
