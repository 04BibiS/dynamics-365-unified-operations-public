-   **Retail store management** workspace Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Channel summary report**
-   **Retail store financials** workspace Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail store financials** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Channel summary report**
-   **Inquiries and reports** section Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports** &gt; **Channel summary report**
