Overview of the Upgrade and N-1 Support

As part of the upcoming release we are enabling the upgrade and N-1* support. The key goal of the upgrade and N-1 is to enable the 2012 R3 customers to leverage the benefits of cloud by moving to Dynamics 365 for Operations. These features enable them to do this in a seamless way. The following are key aspects of these features
•         The customer can now perform database upgrade from 2012 R3 to Dynamics 365 for Operations head quarters through the upgrade process 
•         The customer can operate their stores with the components of the 2012 R3 CU10 version using N-1 support 
•         The upgrade can be validated using pre check and post check validation built in as part of the upgrade process
•         The upgrade process has enhanced error handling and messaging for debugging failures quickly
•         The customer can now use tools to bring forward custom code in X++ for the head quarters.
 
(*  N-1 support is the capability for enabling the Stores running 2012 R3 CU version, to be able to work against a Dynamics 365 for Operations head quarters, after the upgrade. We are initially supporting 2012 R3 CU10 for N-1 capability) 
  
The Upgrade procedure is largely the same as upgrading Dynamics 365 for Operations to the latest version. There will be a planned down time involved. The key difference is in the data upgrade step, first the upgrade analysis is done. The upgrade analysis runs against 2012 database and is based on LCS diagnostic service. This step identifies tasks to help make upgrade faster, cheaper. It also identified the required SQL configuration, data cleanup, and deprecated features
  
The actual data upgrade process then happens, to move the 2012 database to SQL Azure and then execute data upgrade package as normal through the run book process. After this the upgrade validation is done. A validation tool is run against upgraded environment before using it. This tool performs an automated smoke test to check things like whether service is running and accessible, row counts match, financial and inventory reconcile etc.
 
Most of the post upgrade configuration for retail channels are abstracted from user, so the user will have to perform minimal number of manual steps for upgrade and N-1. The customers can use the pre and post upgrade task check lists to learn about the required tasks to be completed
Some of the post upgrade tasks include validating channels, registers and devices on upgraded DB, validating transaction sync, validating N-1 support etc.
 
For N-1 support, the customer will have to install the N-1 package from headquarters. This must be done during the upgrade window and the N-1 related configurations must be completed. After the headquarters upgrade and N-1 set up is complete, the N-1 store components can communicate with the Dynamics 365 for Operations headquarters. There are no channel side components that need to be installed for N-1 Support. We will require the cashier password change during the first-time login, for the N-1 Store to communicate with the Dynamics 365 for operations headquarters. For N-1, we will be supporting 2012 R3 CU 10. After this more CU versions will be supported. The customer has to upgrade to supported CU version before upgrade if they want to have n-1 support for the stores. 
 
The N-1 setup will require customers to install the N-1 package for the headquarter, there is no set up required in the stores. The instructions for the N-1 setup can be found here <Link to N-1 Set up documentation by Jarad>
