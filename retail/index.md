## Channel management
As you set up your Retail experience, you'll decide how to define and configure your stores – brick and mortar store, online store, and call center.

Each retail store can have its own payment methods, delivery methods, price groups, income/expense accounts, registers, and staff. After you create your retail store, you create an assortment of products that you want the store to carry. You can also define store-specific prices and discounts that are applicable to products that are available in the store.

## Clienteling and loyalty
Customers’ needs are changing all the time. You need to quickly and effectively keep up with changes in buying habits and trends in order to target and attract new customers, as well as keep your existing customer base happy.

Furthermore, customers have many options for getting what they want, when they want it, at the price they want. You can better keep customers’ loyalty with personalized notifications and offers for ease of shopping. 

## Hardware and peripherals
Retail Modern point of sale (POS) and Cloud POS can utilize a wide range of hardware peripherals, with multiple interfaces and deployment options to achieve your various business scenarios.

The Peripheral simulator for Retail includes a virtual peripheral simulator and a point of sale (POS) simulator. The virtual peripheral simulator is provided primarily to support testing of scenarios that usually require physical POS peripheral devices. The POS simulator is used to test the compatibility of physical peripheral devices with Retail without having to deploy the POS client.

## Intelligence
Advanced analytics bring the power of machine learning to retail challenges, enabling predictive, optimized, and personalized insights that lead to growth and profitability. With Dynamics 365 for Retail, you can deliver visual reports on any device—online or offline. Additionally, you can help customers identify products and services that meet their needs pre-purchase.  

## Monitoring and diagnosis
With Dynamics 365 for Retail, you can monitor sales and margin performance in real time across different levels of the organization hierarchy.

## Merchandising
Before you can offer products for sale in your retail channels, you'll need to create and configure the products in Dynamics 365 for Retail. You can create the products, define the product properties and attributes, and assign the products to retail category hierarchies. To make the products available to your retail channels and add them to an active assortment, you'll then release the products to the legal entities in which they are available.

You can make price adjustments to products, and can also set up discounts that are applied to a line item or a transaction at the POS, in a call center sales order, or in an online order.

## Store operations and POS
Retail Modern POS (MPOS) is a point-of-sale app for PCs, tablets, and phones. Sales staff can process sales transactions and customer orders, perform clienteling activities, and perform daily operations and inventory management with mobile devices anywhere in the store, as well as at PC-based registers. Cloud POS is a browser-based POS that can be launched on any standard browser.

There are several components you’ll set up to define the relationships among a store, the POS registers within the store, and the retail peripherals that those registers use to process transactions. You’ll also define the characteristics of a specific instance of the POS, including the hardware profile or setup for retail peripherals that will be used at the register, the store that the register is mapped to, the visual experience for the user who logs on to that register, and the functionalities that are enabled in the register. You'll also define whether the register can operate in a disconnected or offline state.

## Workforce management
To be profitable in reducing margin environment, retailers are constantly striving to reduce their operational cost. For most retailers, retail staff cost is a significant portion of the operational cost and so by controlling this cost, they can make a significant impact on their bottom-line. Also, an empowered and productive workforce lends itself to improved customer experience.

With Retail, store managers can create and publish shifts and schedules for workers in stores, annotate shifts with instructions,copy schedules from a previous week to the current week, have visibility into absence requests submitted by retail workers and have the ability to approve or reject requests, and have visibility into shift swap and offer shift requests and have the ability to approve or reject requests. Store associates can have visibility into shifts and assigned schedules, along with instructions for the shift, have visibility as to co-workers assigned to shifts, submit absence requests, submit requests for shift swaps with co-workers, and submit requests for an ‘Offer shift’.
