## Enable Bing Maps

2. Select **Enable Bing Maps** to turn on Bing Maps functionality.

## Enter a Bing Maps license key

Go to the [Bing Maps licensing page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390116) for details on how to
obtain a key.

1. Go to **Retail Shared Parameters** > **Bing**.
2. Enter the license key in the **API key** field.

## Privacy notice

If you enable the Bing Maps feature address information is automatically sent over the Internet to the Bing Maps service to display an online map of the address within this application.  If you click on Bing Maps within this application, you will be redirected to [www.bing.com/maps](http://www.bing.com/maps). Your use of Bing Maps is also governed by the [Bing Maps End User Terms of Use](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837).
