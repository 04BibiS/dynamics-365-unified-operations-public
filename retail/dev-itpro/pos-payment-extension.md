# POS payment extension

With the extension points in POS to support payment extensibility, you can implement the core payment logic in the payment device or payment connector using the Hardware station APIs. Some scenarios where you might want to do this are:
- You need to pass additional information such as extension properties to your connector/device.
- You want to show some custom messages in between the payment flow.
- You need some input from cashier to complete the flow and send some intermediate response back to the payment device/connector. For example, you might need the Customer ID validation status or voice authorization. 
- You want to show some processing dialogs like waiting for customer pin input. 
You can override POS payment request to implement these scenarios.

Below are the request handlers you can override from the POS side to customize the payment flow:

- PaymentTerminalAuthorizePaymentRequestHandler
- PaymentTerminalCapturePaymentRequestHandler
- PaymentTerminalExecuteTaskRequestHandler
- PaymentTerminalRefundPaymentRequestHandler
- PaymentTerminalVoidPaymentRequestHandler

The POS runtime checks the extension manifest to see if there are any extensions for these request handlers. If there are extensions, then the runtime loads the extended requests and executes the overridden requests. In the extension project, you can override these requests and add your own implementation to call the custom payment providers and update the response based on status returned by your providers. When you override a request, you are overriding only the core logic. Calling the methods in Hardware station and process the response per your own logic to show some custom messages or calling the Hardware station again by passing some additional information or sending some intermediate response back to Hardware station like voice authorization code, customer ID validation status etc.). After all your custom logic is done send the updated response you received from Hardware station (Payment device/connector) to POS, you no need to worry about how we add/void/decline the payment line and conclude the transaction based on the response, all the standard workflow is taken care by the POS.

## PaymentTerminalAuthorizePaymentRequestHandler

Authorize request is core payment request from POS which initiates and authorize the card payment request, you can override this request if you want to change anything in the authorize workflow. To override the request, you need to extend the PaymentTerminalAuthorizePaymentRequestHandlerin POS:

```

After implementing the request logic you need to update the manifest.json with the extension information so that POS knows to load the extension:

```typescript
{
    "$schema": "../manifestSchema.json",
        "name": "Pos_Payment_Samples",
            "publisher": "Microsoft",
                "version": "7.2.0",
                    "minimumPosVersion": "7.2.0.0",
                        "components": {
        "extend": {
            "requestHandlers": [
                {
                    "modulePath": "Peripherals/Handlers/PaymentTerminalAuthorizePaymentRequestHandlerExt"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The full E2E sample with how to pass extension properties is available in Retail SDK app update 3: RetailSDK\Code\POS\Extensions\ PaymentSample.

<B>Note:</B> If you check in the above sample we just overridden the calling part and not the core logic on how to complete the payment or add payment line, it’s all taken care by the core POS workflow.

<B>PaymentTerminalCapturePaymentRequestHandler:</B>

Capture request is another payment request from POS which initiates and capture the card payment request, you can override this request if you want to change anything in the capture workflow. To override the request, you need to extend the PaymentTerminalCapturePaymentRequestHandler in POS:

                return this.defaultExecuteAsync(newRequest);
            });
    }
}
```

After implementing the request logic you need to update the manifest.json with the extension information so that POS knows to load the extension, whichever request you override you need to specify that in the manifest. If you didn’t override any of our standard request then you no need to specify it in the manifest:

<B>PaymentTerminalExecuteTaskRequestHandler:</B>

Execute task request is used from POS to initiates any custom payment device/connector operation from POS. Ex: To do health check of the payment device from POS or to do some batch processing, EOD request to payment device etc. you can override this request if you want to do any custom operation other than the standard authorize, capture, void and refund. To override the request, you need to extend the PaymentTerminalExecuteTaskRequestHandlerin POS:

## PaymentTerminalRefundPaymentRequestHandler

Refund request is another payment request from POS which initiates and refund/return of the card payment, you can override this request if you want to change anything in the refund workflow. To override the request, you need to extend the PaymentTerminalRefundPaymentRequestHandler in POS.

## PaymentTerminalVoidPaymentRequestHandler

Void request is another payment request from POS which initiates the void card payment request, you can override this request if you want to change anything in the void workflow. To override the request, you need to extend the PaymentTerminalVoidPaymentRequestHandler in POS.
How to extend the void and refund request code pattern is same as the authorize and capture request. The full E2E sample for void and refund payment request with how to pass extension properties is available in Retail SDK app update 3: RetailSDK\Code\POS\Extensions\ PaymentSample.
